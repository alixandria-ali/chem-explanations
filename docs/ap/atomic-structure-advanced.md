# Advanced Atomic Structure

## Explanation

Advanced atomic structure explores quantum mechanical models that explain electron behavior, orbital shapes, and chemical properties at a deeper level than introductory chemistry.

### Key Concepts

**Quantum Numbers**:
Each electron is described by four quantum numbers:

1. **Principal quantum number (\(n\))**: Energy level/shell (1, 2, 3, ...)
   - Larger \(n\) = higher energy, further from nucleus
2. **Angular momentum quantum number (\(l\))**: Sublevel/shape (0 to \(n-1\))
   - \(l = 0\) (s), \(l = 1\) (p), \(l = 2\) (d), \(l = 3\) (f)
3. **Magnetic quantum number (\(m_l\))**: Orbital orientation (\(-l\) to \(+l\))
   - s: 1 orbital, p: 3 orbitals, d: 5 orbitals, f: 7 orbitals
4. **Spin quantum number (\(m_s\))**: Electron spin (\(+\frac{1}{2}\) or \(-\frac{1}{2}\))

**Pauli Exclusion Principle**: No two electrons can have the same set of four quantum numbers.

**Hund's Rule**: Electrons occupy orbitals of equal energy singly before pairing.

**Aufbau Principle**: Electrons fill lowest energy orbitals first.

**Electron Configuration**:
- Order of filling: 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, 5s, 4d, 5p, 6s, 4f, 5d, 6p, 7s, 5f, 6d...
- Noble gas notation: Use previous noble gas + remaining electrons
- Example: Fe (26 electrons): \([Ar]3d^6 4s^2\) or \([Ar]4s^2 3d^6\)

**Orbital Diagrams**: Show individual electrons in orbitals using arrows (↑↓)

**Exceptions**: Cr and Cu have unusual configurations for extra stability
- Cr: \([Ar]4s^1 3d^5\) (not \(4s^2 3d^4\)) - half-filled d sublevel
- Cu: \([Ar]4s^1 3d^{10}\) (not \(4s^2 3d^9\)) - filled d sublevel

**Photoelectron Spectroscopy (PES)**:
- Measures ionization energies of electrons
- Peaks correspond to electrons in different orbitals
- Peak height = number of electrons
- Peak position = binding energy (lower energy = easier to remove)

**Periodic Trends (Advanced)**:
- **Ionization energy**: Energy to remove electron. Increases left to right, decreases down group
- **Electron affinity**: Energy change when electron is added. Becomes more negative left to right
- **Electronegativity**: Attraction for bonding electrons. Increases left to right, decreases down
- Exceptions due to electron configuration (e.g., removing from full or half-filled sublevel)

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: Determining Quantum Numbers

**Problem**: Write the four quantum numbers for the last electron in nitrogen (\(N\), atomic number 7).

**Solution**:
1. Electron configuration: \(1s^2 2s^2 2p^3\)
2. Last electron is in 2p orbital
3. For 2p:
   - \(n = 2\) (second shell)
   - \(l = 1\) (p sublevel)
   - \(m_l = -1, 0, +1\) (three p orbitals)
4. Using Hund's rule: electrons in 2p occupy separate orbitals first
5. Three 2p electrons go in \(m_l = -1, 0, +1\) with parallel spins
6. Last electron could be in any of these, say \(m_l = +1\)
7. \(m_s = +\frac{1}{2}\) (unpaired, spin up)

**Answer**: \(n = 2\), \(l = 1\), \(m_l = +1\) (or 0 or -1), \(m_s = +\frac{1}{2}\)

### Example 2: Writing Electron Configuration with Exceptions

**Problem**: Write the complete and noble gas electron configurations for chromium (Cr, atomic number 24).

**Solution**:
1. Expected configuration: \([Ar]4s^2 3d^4\)
2. However, Cr is an exception for stability
3. Half-filled d sublevel (\(3d^5\)) is more stable
4. One electron from 4s moves to 3d
5. Actual configuration: \([Ar]4s^1 3d^5\)
6. Complete: \(1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^6 4s^1 3d^5\)

**Answer**: Noble gas: \([Ar]4s^1 3d^5\). Complete: \(1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^6 4s^1 3d^5\)

### Example 3: Interpreting Photoelectron Spectrum

**Problem**: A PES for an unknown element shows peaks at binding energies (relative units): 1000, 500, 50, 30, with relative peak areas 2:2:6:1. Identify the element.

**Solution**:
1. Peak areas correspond to number of electrons:
   - 2 electrons at binding energy 1000 (highest, closest to nucleus)
   - 2 electrons at 500
   - 6 electrons at 50
   - 1 electron at 30 (lowest, easiest to remove)
2. Total electrons: \(2 + 2 + 6 + 1 = 11\)
3. Four peaks suggest four different energy levels/sublevels
4. Pattern: \(1s^2\) (2), \(2s^2\) (2), \(2p^6\) (6), \(3s^1\) (1)
5. Element with 11 electrons: Sodium (Na)

**Answer**: The element is sodium (Na) with configuration \(1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^1\)

## Practice Problems

1. How many orbitals are in the \(n = 3\) shell? How many electrons can this shell hold?

2. Write the four quantum numbers for an electron in a 3d orbital.

3. Write the complete electron configuration for sulfur (S, atomic number 16).

4. Write the noble gas configuration for copper (Cu, atomic number 29). Remember Cu is an exception.

5. Draw the orbital diagram for oxygen (\(O\), atomic number 8). Show how electrons fill according to Hund's rule.

6. Which electron is easier to remove: one from \(3s\) or \(3p\)? Explain using energy levels.

7. Explain why the first ionization energy of oxygen is slightly lower than nitrogen, even though oxygen is to the right on the periodic table.

8. An element has the electron configuration \([Ar]4s^2 3d^{10} 4p^5\). Identify the element and its group.

9. A PES shows peaks with relative areas 2:2:6:2:6:2:2. How many electrons does the atom have? What could the element be?

10. For the element scandium (Sc, atomic number 21), write the electron configuration and explain which electrons are in the d orbital.

## Answer Key

??? note "Click to reveal answers"
    1. \(n = 3\): sublevels are 3s (1 orbital), 3p (3 orbitals), 3d (5 orbitals). Total: **9 orbitals**. Each holds 2 electrons: **18 electrons maximum**.

    2. \(n = 3\) (third shell), \(l = 2\) (d sublevel), \(m_l = -2, -1, 0, +1, \text{or } +2\) (any of the 5 d orbitals), \(m_s = +\frac{1}{2} \text{ or } -\frac{1}{2}\). **Example: \(n=3, l=2, m_l=0, m_s=+\frac{1}{2}\)**

    3. \(\mathbf{1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^4}\) (total 16 electrons)

    4. \(\mathbf{[Ar]4s^1 3d^{10}}\) or \(\mathbf{[Ar]3d^{10}4s^1}\) (exception: prefers filled d sublevel)

    5. O: \(1s^2 2s^2 2p^4\). Diagram: 1s: ↑↓, 2s: ↑↓, 2p: ↑↓ ↑ ↑ (first orbital paired, next two singly occupied per Hund's rule)

    6. **3s is easier to remove**. The 3s electron has lower binding energy (further from nucleus on average) compared to 3p, making it easier to ionize.

    7. In nitrogen (\(1s^2 2s^2 2p^3\)), the 2p sublevel is **half-filled** (stable). In oxygen (\(1s^2 2s^2 2p^4\)), the fourth 2p electron must pair up, creating **electron-electron repulsion**. This slightly lowers the ionization energy of oxygen.

    8. Total electrons: \(18 + 2 + 10 + 5 = 35\). Element: **Bromine (Br), Group 17** (halogens)

    9. Total: \(2+2+6+2+6+2+2 = 22\) electrons. Element: **Titanium (Ti)**, configuration \(1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^6 4s^2 3d^2\)

    10. Sc: \(\mathbf{[Ar]4s^2 3d^1}\) or \(1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^6 4s^2 3d^1\). **One electron** is in the 3d orbital.
