## Explanation

The periodic table organizes all known elements by atomic number and groups elements with similar properties together.

### Key Concepts

**Organization**:
- **Periods**: Horizontal rows numbered 1-7. Period number = number of electron shells.
- **Groups**: Vertical columns numbered 1-18. Elements in the same group have similar chemical properties.
- Elements are arranged by increasing atomic number (number of protons).

**Important Groups**:
- **Group 1**: Alkali metals (Li, Na, K, etc.) - highly reactive metals, 1 valence electron
- **Group 2**: Alkaline earth metals (Mg, Ca, etc.) - reactive metals, 2 valence electrons
- **Group 17**: Halogens (F, Cl, Br, I) - highly reactive nonmetals, 7 valence electrons
- **Group 18**: Noble gases (He, Ne, Ar, etc.) - unreactive gases, full outer shell

**Metals, Nonmetals, and Metalloids**:
- **Metals**: Left and center of periodic table - shiny, conductive, malleable
- **Nonmetals**: Upper right of periodic table - dull, poor conductors, brittle when solid
- **Metalloids**: Staircase line between metals and nonmetals - properties intermediate

**Periodic Trends**:
- **Atomic radius**: Decreases left to right across a period; increases top to bottom down a group
- **Ionization energy**: Energy to remove an electron. Increases left to right; decreases top to bottom
- **Electronegativity**: Attraction for electrons. Increases left to right; decreases top to bottom

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: Using Period and Group Information

**Problem**: Element X is in Period 3, Group 15. How many electron shells does it have? How many valence electrons? Identify the element.

**Solution**:
1. Period 3 means 3 electron shells
2. Group 15 means 5 valence electrons (for main group elements, valence electrons = group number - 10 for groups 13-18)
3. Period 3, Group 15 is phosphorus (P)
4. Electron configuration: 2, 8, 5

**Answer**: 3 electron shells, 5 valence electrons, element is phosphorus (P).

### Example 2: Comparing Atomic Radius

**Problem**: Arrange these elements in order of increasing atomic radius: Na, Cl, Mg. Explain your reasoning.

**Solution**:
1. All three elements are in Period 3
2. Atomic radius decreases left to right across a period
3. Order in the periodic table: Na (Group 1), Mg (Group 2), Cl (Group 17)
4. Therefore, atomic radius: Cl < Mg < Na

**Answer**: Cl < Mg < Na (increasing atomic radius). Sodium has the largest radius because it's furthest left in Period 3.

### Example 3: Predicting Chemical Properties

**Problem**: Potassium (K) and sodium (Na) are both in Group 1. Based on their position, predict two chemical properties they share.

**Solution**:
1. Both are in Group 1 (alkali metals)
2. Elements in the same group have similar properties
3. Group 1 properties:
   - Both have 1 valence electron
   - Both readily lose that electron to form +1 ions (\(K^+\), \(Na^+\))
   - Both are highly reactive metals
   - Both react vigorously with water

**Answer**: K and Na both (1) have 1 valence electron and form +1 ions, and (2) are highly reactive metals that react vigorously with water.

## Practice Problems

1. Element Y is in Period 2, Group 16. How many electron shells and valence electrons does it have? Identify the element.

2. Which element has more protons: nitrogen (N, atomic number 7) or phosphorus (P, atomic number 15)?

3. Arrange these elements in order of increasing atomic radius: F, Cl, Br (all Group 17).

4. Which has higher ionization energy: Na or Mg? Explain why.

5. Identify whether each element is a metal, nonmetal, or metalloid: Ca, S, Si, Ar.

6. Why do elements in Group 18 (noble gases) not readily form compounds?

7. Lithium (Li) and francium (Fr) are both in Group 1. Which has a larger atomic radius? Explain.

8. An element is in Period 4, Group 2. What is its name and how many valence electrons does it have?

9. Compare the electronegativity of oxygen (O) and sulfur (S). Which is higher? Why?

10. An element has 3 electron shells and 7 valence electrons. Identify the element and its group.

## Answer Key

??? note "Click to reveal answers"
1. **2 electron shells**, **6 valence electrons**, element is **oxygen (O)**

2. **Phosphorus (P)** has more protons (15 vs 7)

3. **F < Cl < Br** (atomic radius increases down a group)

4. **Mg has higher ionization energy**. Ionization energy increases left to right across a period, and Mg is to the right of Na in Period 3.

5. **Ca = metal**, **S = nonmetal**, **Si = metalloid**, **Ar = nonmetal** (noble gas)

6. Noble gases have **full outer electron shells** (8 valence electrons, except He with 2), making them stable and unreactive.

7. **Francium (Fr)** has a larger atomic radius. Atomic radius increases down a group, and Fr is much further down Group 1 than Li.

8. **Calcium (Ca)**, **2 valence electrons**

9. **Oxygen has higher electronegativity**. Electronegativity decreases down a group, and O is above S in Group 16.

10. Period 3 (3 shells), Group 17 (7 valence electrons): **Chlorine (Cl)**
