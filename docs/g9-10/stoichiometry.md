## Explanation

Stoichiometry is the study of quantitative relationships in chemical reactions. It allows us to predict how much product forms or how much reactant is needed. Think of it as the "recipe math" of chemistry - just as a recipe tells you how much of each ingredient you need to make a certain amount of food, stoichiometry tells you the precise quantities of reactants needed to produce a desired amount of product.

### Understanding the Mole: The Chemist's Counting Unit

**Step 1: Why Do We Need the Mole?**

Atoms and molecules are incredibly small - too small to count individually. Imagine trying to count out individual water molecules to make a glass of water! Instead, chemists use the mole as a counting unit, similar to how we use "dozen" for 12 items or "gross" for 144 items.

**Step 2: What is a Mole?**

- The mole (mol) is the SI unit for amount of substance
- 1 mole = \(6.022 \times 10^{23}\) particles (this is called Avogadro's number)
- This number was chosen because it connects the atomic mass scale to a measurable quantity in grams
- **Why this matters**: 1 mole of any element has a mass in grams equal to its atomic mass on the periodic table

**Step 3: Understanding Molar Mass**

Molar mass is the mass of one mole of a substance, measured in g/mol. Here's how to find it:

- **For elements**: Look at the atomic mass on the periodic table. For example:
  - Carbon (C): 12.0 g/mol
  - Oxygen (O): 16.0 g/mol
  - Hydrogen (H): 1.0 g/mol

- **For compounds**: Add up the atomic masses of all atoms in the formula:
  - Water (\(H_2O\)): \(2(1.0) + 16.0 = 18.0 \text{ g/mol}\)
  - Carbon dioxide (\(CO_2\)): \(12.0 + 2(16.0) = 44.0 \text{ g/mol}\)
  - Glucose (\(C_6H_{12}O_6\)): \(6(12.0) + 12(1.0) + 6(16.0) = 180.0 \text{ g/mol}\)

### Converting Between Mass, Moles, and Particles

These three quantities are interconnected, and you need to move between them frequently:

**Step 1: The Mass-Mole Relationship**

\[\text{moles} = \frac{\text{mass (g)}}{\text{molar mass (g/mol)}}\]

Or rearranged: \[\text{mass (g)} = \text{moles} \times \text{molar mass (g/mol)}\]

**Why this works**: Molar mass is a conversion factor that bridges the gap between the microscopic world (atoms/molecules) and the macroscopic world (grams we can measure).

**Step 2: The Mole-Particle Relationship**

\[\text{particles} = \text{moles} \times 6.022 \times 10^{23}\]

Or: \[\text{moles} = \frac{\text{particles}}{6.022 \times 10^{23}}\]

**Why this works**: Avogadro's number is the "bridge" between the mole and individual particles.

**Step 3: The Conversion Triangle**

Think of conversions as a triangle:
- Mass (grams) ↔ Moles ↔ Particles (atoms, molecules, formula units)
- You ALWAYS go through moles to convert between mass and particles
- Never try to convert directly from mass to particles!

### Balancing Chemical Equations: The Foundation

**Step 1: Why Balance Equations?**

The Law of Conservation of Mass states that matter cannot be created or destroyed in a chemical reaction. This means:
- The number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides
- Only the arrangement of atoms changes, not the total count

**Step 2: What Do the Numbers Mean?**

- **Coefficients** (numbers in front of formulas): Show the ratio of moles of each substance
  - In \(2H_2 + O_2 \rightarrow 2H_2O\), the coefficient "2" means 2 moles
- **Subscripts** (numbers within formulas): Show the number of atoms in one molecule
  - In \(H_2O\), the subscript "2" means 2 hydrogen atoms per molecule
- **Never change subscripts** - that would change the chemical identity!

**Step 3: How to Balance**

1. Count atoms of each element on both sides
2. Add coefficients to balance, starting with the most complex molecule
3. Balance elements that appear in only one reactant and one product first
4. Save hydrogen and oxygen for last (they're often in multiple compounds)
5. Check your work by counting all atoms

**Example**: \(Al + O_2 \rightarrow Al_2O_3\)
- Al: 1 on left, 2 on right → Need coefficient of 2 on left
- O: 2 on left, 3 on right → Need to find common multiple (6)
- Balanced: \(4Al + 3O_2 \rightarrow 2Al_2O_3\)

### Stoichiometric Calculations: The Four-Step Method

**Step 1: Write and Balance the Chemical Equation**

This is non-negotiable! An unbalanced equation will give you wrong answers. The coefficients represent the mole ratios you'll use.

**Why this matters**: The coefficients tell you the "recipe" - how many moles of each reactant combine to make products.

**Step 2: Convert Given Quantity to Moles**

Whether you're given mass, volume, or particles, convert to moles first. Moles are the "common language" of stoichiometry.

- If given mass: Use \(\text{moles} = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{molar mass}}\)
- If given particles: Use \(\text{moles} = \frac{\text{particles}}{6.022 \times 10^{23}}\)

**Why this matters**: Chemical equations show relationships in moles, not grams or particles.

**Step 3: Use Mole Ratio from Balanced Equation**

The coefficients in your balanced equation give you the mole ratio. Set up a conversion factor:

\[\text{moles of wanted} = \text{moles of given} \times \frac{\text{coefficient of wanted}}{\text{coefficient of given}}\]

**Example**: In \(N_2 + 3H_2 \rightarrow 2NH_3\)
- The ratio of \(H_2\) to \(NH_3\) is 3:2
- If you have 6 mol \(H_2\): \(6 \text{ mol } H_2 \times \frac{2 \text{ mol } NH_3}{3 \text{ mol } H_2} = 4 \text{ mol } NH_3\)

**Why this matters**: This is where the actual stoichiometry happens - translating from what you have to what you want.

**Step 4: Convert to Desired Units**

Convert from moles to whatever unit is requested (mass, particles, volume for gases):

- To get mass: multiply moles by molar mass
- To get particles: multiply moles by Avogadro's number

**Why this matters**: While calculations use moles, real-world applications need practical units like grams.

### Limiting Reactant: Who Runs Out First?

**Understanding the Concept**

In real-world reactions, reactants are rarely present in perfect stoichiometric ratios. One reactant will be completely consumed while the other(s) remain in excess.

**Step 1: What is the Limiting Reactant?**

The limiting reactant is the reactant that is completely consumed first, stopping the reaction. It "limits" how much product can form.

**Why this matters**: In industry, the limiting reactant determines your maximum yield and profit. Excess reactants are often recycled or represent wasted resources.

**Step 2: How to Identify the Limiting Reactant**

Method 1 (Calculate product from each reactant):
1. Calculate how much product each reactant could produce if it were completely consumed
2. The reactant that produces the LEAST amount of product is limiting

Method 2 (Compare mole ratios):
1. Divide the moles of each reactant by its coefficient
2. The reactant with the smallest result is limiting

**Step 3: Working with the Limiting Reactant**

- Use ONLY the limiting reactant to calculate theoretical yield
- The excess reactant(s) will have some left over after the reaction
- To find how much excess remains: Calculate how much was consumed, subtract from starting amount

### Percent Yield: Theory vs. Reality

**Understanding the Concept**

In theory, chemical reactions should produce a specific amount of product based on stoichiometry. In practice, you always get less.

**Step 1: Types of Yield**

- **Theoretical Yield**: Maximum amount of product possible, calculated from stoichiometry
- **Actual Yield**: Amount of product actually obtained in the lab
- **Percent Yield**: How efficient your reaction was

\[\text{Percent Yield} = \frac{\text{Actual Yield}}{\text{Theoretical Yield}} \times 100\%\]

**Step 2: Why is Actual Yield Always Less?**

- Product lost during transfer or purification
- Side reactions produce unwanted products
- Reaction doesn't go to completion (equilibrium is established)
- Product may decompose
- Human error in measurement

**Why this matters**: In industry, percent yield affects profitability. A 90% yield means 10% of your reactants are "wasted." For expensive reactants, this matters!

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: Converting Mass to Moles

**Problem**: How many moles are in 36 grams of water (\(H_2O\))?

**Solution**:
1. Find molar mass of \(H_2O\):
   - H: \(1.0 \text{ g/mol} \times 2 = 2.0 \text{ g/mol}\)
   - O: \(16.0 \text{ g/mol} \times 1 = 16.0 \text{ g/mol}\)
   - Total: \(2.0 + 16.0 = 18.0 \text{ g/mol}\)
2. Use the formula: \(\text{moles} = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{molar mass}}\)
3. \(\text{moles} = \frac{36 \text{ g}}{18.0 \text{ g/mol}} = 2.0 \text{ mol}\)

**Answer**: 2.0 moles of water

---

### Example 2: Stoichiometric Calculation

**Problem**: Given the reaction \(N_2 + 3H_2 \rightarrow 2NH_3\), how many moles of ammonia (\(NH_3\)) can be produced from 4.0 moles of hydrogen (\(H_2\))?

**Solution**:
1. The balanced equation shows the mole ratio: 3 moles \(H_2\) produces 2 moles \(NH_3\)
2. Set up proportion: \(\frac{3 \text{ mol } H_2}{2 \text{ mol } NH_3} = \frac{4.0 \text{ mol } H_2}{x \text{ mol } NH_3}\)
3. Solve: \(x = \frac{4.0 \text{ mol } H_2 \times 2 \text{ mol } NH_3}{3 \text{ mol } H_2} = \frac{8.0}{3} = 2.67 \text{ mol } NH_3\)

**Answer**: 2.67 moles of ammonia can be produced

---

### Example 3: Limiting Reactant Problem

**Problem**: For the reaction \(2Mg + O_2 \rightarrow 2MgO\), if you have 4.0 moles of \(Mg\) and 1.5 moles of \(O_2\), which is the limiting reactant? How many moles of \(MgO\) can form?

**Solution**:
1. Calculate how much product each reactant can produce:
2. From \(Mg\): \(4.0 \text{ mol } Mg \times \frac{2 \text{ mol } MgO}{2 \text{ mol } Mg} = 4.0 \text{ mol } MgO\)
3. From \(O_2\): \(1.5 \text{ mol } O_2 \times \frac{2 \text{ mol } MgO}{1 \text{ mol } O_2} = 3.0 \text{ mol } MgO\)
4. \(O_2\) produces less product, so it is the **limiting reactant**
5. Maximum \(MgO\) that can form: 3.0 mol (determined by the limiting reactant)

**Answer**: \(O_2\) is the limiting reactant. 3.0 moles of \(MgO\) can form.

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Forgetting to Balance the Equation First

**What students do**: Jump straight into calculations using an unbalanced equation.

**Why it's wrong**: Unbalanced equations give incorrect mole ratios. For example, using \(H_2 + O_2 \rightarrow H_2O\) (unbalanced) would suggest a 1:1 ratio between \(H_2\) and \(H_2O\), when the correct ratio is 2:2 or 1:1 only after proper balancing to \(2H_2 + O_2 \rightarrow 2H_2O\).

**How to avoid it**: ALWAYS write and balance your equation as the very first step. Double-check that atoms are conserved on both sides before proceeding with any calculations.

### Mistake 2: Using Mass Ratios Instead of Mole Ratios

**What students do**: Try to use the coefficients in a balanced equation as mass ratios. For example, thinking that in \(2H_2 + O_2 \rightarrow 2H_2O\), 2 grams of hydrogen reacts with 1 gram of oxygen.

**Why it's wrong**: Coefficients represent mole ratios, not mass ratios. Different substances have different molar masses, so equal moles don't have equal masses. In the example above, 2 moles of \(H_2\) (4 g) actually reacts with 1 mole of \(O_2\) (32 g).

**How to avoid it**: Always convert masses to moles before using stoichiometric ratios. Remember: balanced equation coefficients = mole ratios, NOT mass ratios.

### Mistake 3: Assuming All Reactants Are Used Up Completely

**What students do**: Calculate product amounts using all given reactants without checking for a limiting reactant.

**Why it's wrong**: When reactants aren't in perfect stoichiometric ratios, one will run out first. Calculating as if both reactants are completely consumed overestimates product formation.

**How to avoid it**: When given amounts of multiple reactants, ALWAYS check which is limiting. Calculate the potential product from each reactant separately, and use the smaller value. The limiting reactant determines maximum product formation.

### Mistake 4: Confusing Theoretical Yield with Actual Yield

**What students do**: Use the actual yield (what was obtained) instead of theoretical yield (what stoichiometry predicts) when calculating how much product should form.

**Why it's wrong**: The theoretical yield is the maximum possible based on stoichiometry and assumes 100% efficiency. Actual yield is always less due to practical limitations. Using actual yield in stoichiometric calculations introduces errors.

**How to avoid it**: Theoretical yield comes from stoichiometric calculations using the limiting reactant. Actual yield is given or measured in the lab. Only calculate percent yield AFTER you've found theoretical yield from stoichiometry.

### Mistake 5: Incorrect Unit Conversions

**What students do**: Forget to convert units, mix up molar mass with number of moles, or use incorrect forms of Avogadro's number.

**Why it's wrong**: Using 6.022 × 10²³ as a mass, or forgetting to divide by molar mass leads to answers that are off by factors of millions or billions. Unit analysis will show the error (you might get mol²/g instead of mol).

**How to avoid it**:
- Always write units in your calculations
- Use dimensional analysis: units should cancel to give the desired final unit
- Remember: \(\frac{\text{mass (g)}}{\text{molar mass (g/mol)}} = \text{moles}\)
- Avogadro's number has units of particles/mol, NOT particles/g

## Answer Key

??? note "Click to reveal answers"

    ### Problem 1: Answer (B) 4.0 g

    **Step-by-step solution**:

    Step 1: Identify what you're given and what you need to find
    - Given: 2.0 moles of \(H_2O\) needed, excess \(O_2\)
    - Find: mass of \(H_2\) required

    Step 2: Analyze the balanced equation
    - \(2H_2 + O_2 \rightarrow 2H_2O\)
    - Mole ratio: 2 mol \(H_2\) : 2 mol \(H_2O\) = 1:1

    Step 3: Use stoichiometry to find moles of \(H_2\)
    - \(2.0 \text{ mol } H_2O \times \frac{2 \text{ mol } H_2}{2 \text{ mol } H_2O} = 2.0 \text{ mol } H_2\)

    Step 4: Convert moles to mass
    - Molar mass of \(H_2 = 2(1.0) = 2.0 \text{ g/mol}\)
    - Mass \(= 2.0 \text{ mol} \times 2.0 \text{ g/mol} = 4.0 \text{ g}\)

    **Why this approach**: We must use the mole ratio from the balanced equation, then convert to mass using molar mass. The 1:1 ratio makes this straightforward.

    **Common mistake to avoid**: Don't use the molar mass of water (18.0 g/mol) - that would give you answer (C). We need the mass of hydrogen, not water!

    ---

    ### Problem 2: Answer (C) 24.0 g

    **Step-by-step solution**:

    Step 1: Convert given mass to moles
    - Molar mass of \(CO_2 = 12.0 + 2(16.0) = 44.0 \text{ g/mol}\)
    - Moles of \(CO_2 = \frac{44.0 \text{ g}}{44.0 \text{ g/mol}} = 1.0 \text{ mol}\)

    Step 2: Use balanced equation to find mole ratio
    - \(C_3H_8 + 5O_2 \rightarrow 3CO_2 + 4H_2O\)
    - Ratio: 3 mol \(CO_2\) : 4 mol \(H_2O\)

    Step 3: Calculate moles of water produced
    - \(1.0 \text{ mol } CO_2 \times \frac{4 \text{ mol } H_2O}{3 \text{ mol } CO_2} = 1.33 \text{ mol } H_2O\)

    Step 4: Convert to mass
    - Molar mass of \(H_2O = 2(1.0) + 16.0 = 18.0 \text{ g/mol}\)
    - Mass \(= 1.33 \text{ mol} \times 18.0 \text{ g/mol} = 24.0 \text{ g}\)

    **Why this approach**: This is a classic product-to-product stoichiometry problem. We must go through moles and use the mole ratio from the balanced equation.

    **Common mistake to avoid**: Don't assume equal masses of products (answer E). The mole ratio is 3:4, not 1:1, and the molar masses are different!

    ---

    ### Problem 3: Answer (C)

    **Correct answer**: The limiting reactant is NOT always the reactant with the smallest mass.

    **Explanation**: The limiting reactant depends on both the amount present AND the stoichiometric ratio. Consider this example:

    - Reaction: \(2H_2 + O_2 \rightarrow 2H_2O\)
    - If you have 2 g of \(H_2\) (1 mol) and 16 g of \(O_2\) (0.5 mol)
    - Even though \(H_2\) has less mass, \(O_2\) is limiting because you need only 0.5 mol \(O_2\) for 1 mol \(H_2\)

    **Why the other options are true**:
    - (A) True - by definition, the limiting reactant is completely consumed
    - (B) True - it limits how much product forms
    - (D) True - excess reactant has some left over
    - (E) True - you must consider both factors

    **Common mistake to avoid**: Don't just look at masses! Always convert to moles and consider the stoichiometric ratio.

    ---

    ### Problem 4: Answer (B) 2.67 mol

    **Step-by-step solution**:

    Step 1: Calculate potential product from \(N_2\)
    - \(2.0 \text{ mol } N_2 \times \frac{2 \text{ mol } NH_3}{1 \text{ mol } N_2} = 4.0 \text{ mol } NH_3\)
    - ✓ Enter 4.0 in Step 1 of the interactive checker

    Step 2: Calculate potential product from \(H_2\)
    - \(4.0 \text{ mol } H_2 \times \frac{2 \text{ mol } NH_3}{3 \text{ mol } H_2} = 2.67 \text{ mol } NH_3\)
    - ✓ Enter 2.67 in Step 2 of the interactive checker

    Step 3: Identify limiting reactant and final answer
    - \(H_2\) produces less product (2.67 mol vs 4.0 mol)
    - Therefore, \(H_2\) is limiting
    - Maximum \(NH_3\) that can form = 2.67 mol
    - ✓ Enter 2.67 in Step 3 of the interactive checker

    **Why this approach**: When given amounts of multiple reactants, you MUST check which is limiting by calculating the product from each one separately. The smaller value is your answer.

    **Common mistake to avoid**: Don't assume both reactants are completely consumed (that would give you answer D or E). One will run out first!

    ---

    ### Problem 5: Answer (B) 90.0 g

    **Step-by-step solution**:

    Step 1: Convert molecules to moles
    - \(\text{moles} = \frac{3.01 \times 10^{23} \text{ molecules}}{6.022 \times 10^{23} \text{ molecules/mol}} = 0.50 \text{ mol}\)

    Step 2: Convert moles to mass
    - Mass \(= 0.50 \text{ mol} \times 180.0 \text{ g/mol} = 90.0 \text{ g}\)

    **Why this approach**: When converting from particles (molecules, atoms, etc.) to mass, you MUST go through moles. There's no direct conversion from molecules to grams.

    **Common mistake to avoid**: Notice that \(3.01 \times 10^{23}\) is exactly half of Avogadro's number. This should immediately tell you that you have 0.5 mol, not 1 mol (which would give answer C).

    ---

    ### Problem 6: Answer (D) 85.1%

    **Step-by-step solution**:

    Step 1: Identify theoretical and actual yields
    - Theoretical yield = 51.0 g (calculated from stoichiometry)
    - Actual yield = 43.4 g (measured in lab)

    Step 2: Apply percent yield formula
    - \(\text{Percent Yield} = \frac{\text{Actual Yield}}{\text{Theoretical Yield}} \times 100\%\)
    - \(\text{Percent Yield} = \frac{43.4 \text{ g}}{51.0 \text{ g}} \times 100\% = 85.1\%\)

    **Why this approach**: Percent yield compares what you actually got to what you theoretically should have gotten. It's always less than 100% in real experiments.

    **Common mistake to avoid**: Don't put actual yield in the denominator (that gives 117.5%, answer E) or use them backwards. Actual is always on top, theoretical on bottom. A percent yield over 100% is physically impossible in a single reaction!

    ---

    ### Problem 7: Answer (B) 6.72 L

    **Step-by-step solution**:

    Step 1: Convert mass to moles
    - Moles of \(KClO_3 = \frac{24.5 \text{ g}}{122.5 \text{ g/mol}} = 0.200 \text{ mol}\)

    Step 2: Use stoichiometry to find moles of \(O_2\)
    - From equation: \(2KClO_3 \rightarrow 2KCl + 3O_2\)
    - Ratio: 2 mol \(KClO_3\) : 3 mol \(O_2\)
    - \(0.200 \text{ mol } KClO_3 \times \frac{3 \text{ mol } O_2}{2 \text{ mol } KClO_3} = 0.300 \text{ mol } O_2\)

    Step 3: Convert moles to volume at STP
    - Volume \(= 0.300 \text{ mol} \times 22.4 \text{ L/mol} = 6.72 \text{ L}\)

    **Why this approach**: Gas stoichiometry adds one more step - converting moles to volume using the molar volume at STP (22.4 L/mol). This is a standard conversion for gases.

    **Common mistake to avoid**: Don't forget the stoichiometric ratio! The ratio is 2:3, not 1:1. If you used 1:1, you'd get answer A (4.48 L).

    ### Problem 8: Answer (B)

    **Step-by-step solution**:

    Step 1: Convert masses to moles
    - Molar mass of \(N_2 = 2(14.0) = 28.0 \text{ g/mol}\)
    - Moles of \(N_2 = \frac{14.0 \text{ g}}{28.0 \text{ g/mol}} = 0.50 \text{ mol}\)
    - Molar mass of \(H_2 = 2(1.0) = 2.0 \text{ g/mol}\)
    - Moles of \(H_2 = \frac{6.0 \text{ g}}{2.0 \text{ g/mol}} = 3.0 \text{ mol}\)

    Step 2: Calculate potential product from each reactant
    - From \(N_2\): \(0.50 \text{ mol } N_2 \times \frac{2 \text{ mol } NH_3}{1 \text{ mol } N_2} = 1.0 \text{ mol } NH_3\)
    - From \(H_2\): \(3.0 \text{ mol } H_2 \times \frac{2 \text{ mol } NH_3}{3 \text{ mol } H_2} = 2.0 \text{ mol } NH_3\)

    Step 3: Identify limiting reactant
    - \(N_2\) produces less product (1.0 mol vs 2.0 mol)
    - **\(N_2\) is limiting** - this eliminates answers B and D

    Step 4: Convert moles to mass
    - Wait! Let me recalculate - actually \(N_2\) produces 1.0 mol, but let me check the stoichiometry again
    - Actually, from \(H_2\): \(3.0 \text{ mol } H_2 \times \frac{2 \text{ mol } NH_3}{3 \text{ mol } H_2} = 2.0 \text{ mol } NH_3\)
    - From \(N_2\): \(0.50 \text{ mol } N_2 \times \frac{2 \text{ mol } NH_3}{1 \text{ mol } N_2} = 1.0 \text{ mol } NH_3\)
    - \(N_2\) is limiting, produces 1.0 mol \(NH_3\)
    - Mass of \(NH_3 = 1.0 \text{ mol} \times 17.0 \text{ g/mol} = 17.0 \text{ g}\)

    Wait, let me reconsider. Looking at the molar ratios:
    - Need 1 mol \(N_2\) : 3 mol \(H_2\)
    - Have 0.50 mol \(N_2\) : 3.0 mol \(H_2\)
    - For 0.50 mol \(N_2\), need 1.5 mol \(H_2\)
    - Have 3.0 mol \(H_2\), so \(H_2\) is in excess
    - \(N_2\) is limiting

    But checking answer B: "Hydrogen is the limiting reactant and 17.0 g of \(NH_3\) can form"

    Let me recalculate completely:
    - For 3.0 mol \(H_2\), need 1.0 mol \(N_2\)
    - Have only 0.50 mol \(N_2\)
    - Therefore \(N_2\) IS limiting

    So answer should be A: "Nitrogen is the limiting reactant and 17.0 g of \(NH_3\) can form"

    Actually, given the answer is B, let me verify once more:
    - From 0.50 mol \(N_2\): produces 1.0 mol \(NH_3\) = 17.0 g
    - From 3.0 mol \(H_2\): produces 2.0 mol \(NH_3\) = 34.0 g
    - Nitrogen produces less, so N₂ is limiting and 17.0 g can form

    **The answer is actually (A)**, not (B) as I initially stated. Let me correct this:

    **Correct Answer: (A) Nitrogen is the limiting reactant and 17.0 g of NH₃ can form**

    **Why this approach**: Multi-step problem requiring (1) mass to moles conversion for both reactants, (2) limiting reactant determination, and (3) moles to mass conversion for product.

    **Common mistake to avoid**: Don't assume the reactant with smaller mass is limiting! You must convert to moles and check the stoichiometry.

    ### Problem 9: Answer (B) 16.0 g

    **Step-by-step solution**:

    Step 1: Convert masses to moles
    - Moles of \(CH_4 = \frac{16.0 \text{ g}}{16.0 \text{ g/mol}} = 1.0 \text{ mol}\)
    - Moles of \(O_2 = \frac{80.0 \text{ g}}{32.0 \text{ g/mol}} = 2.5 \text{ mol}\)

    Step 2: Determine limiting reactant
    - From equation: \(CH_4 + 2O_2 \rightarrow CO_2 + 2H_2O\)
    - Ratio needed: 1 mol \(CH_4\) : 2 mol \(O_2\)
    - For 1.0 mol \(CH_4\), need 2.0 mol \(O_2\)
    - Have 2.5 mol \(O_2\), so \(CH_4\) is limiting

    Step 3: Calculate excess \(O_2\) consumed
    - \(1.0 \text{ mol } CH_4 \times \frac{2 \text{ mol } O_2}{1 \text{ mol } CH_4} = 2.0 \text{ mol } O_2\) consumed

    Step 4: Calculate excess remaining
    - Excess \(O_2\) remaining \(= 2.5 - 2.0 = 0.5 \text{ mol}\)
    - Mass \(= 0.5 \text{ mol} \times 32.0 \text{ g/mol} = 16.0 \text{ g}\)

    **Why this approach**: To find excess reactant remaining, you must (1) identify the limiting reactant, (2) calculate how much excess reactant is consumed, (3) subtract from starting amount.

    **Common mistake to avoid**: Don't just subtract the mass of the limiting reactant from the total! The excess reactant is partially consumed, so you need to calculate exactly how much was used.

    ### Problem 10: Answer (D) 641 g

    **Step-by-step solution**:

    Step 1: Understand what's being asked
    - Need 500.0 g of final product (after losses)
    - Yield is 78%, meaning only 78% of what you synthesize will be usable
    - Need to find: how much to synthesize initially

    Step 2: Set up percent yield equation
    - \(\text{Percent Yield} = \frac{\text{Actual Yield}}{\text{Theoretical Yield}} \times 100\%\)
    - \(78\% = \frac{500.0 \text{ g}}{\text{Theoretical Yield}} \times 100\%\)

    Step 3: Solve for theoretical yield
    - \(\text{Theoretical Yield} = \frac{500.0 \text{ g}}{0.78} = 641 \text{ g}\)

    **Why this approach**: This is a "reverse" percent yield problem. Instead of calculating percent yield, you're given the yield and actual amount needed, and must find how much to synthesize. This tests understanding of what percent yield really means.

    **Common mistake to avoid**: Don't multiply 500 by 0.78 (that gives 390 g, answer A) - that would give you less than what you need! Since yield is less than 100%, you must synthesize MORE than your target amount.
