## Explanation

Stoichiometry is the study of quantitative relationships in chemical reactions. It allows us to predict how much product forms or how much reactant is needed.

### Key Concepts

**The Mole**:
- The mole (mol) is the SI unit for amount of substance
- 1 mole = \(6.022 \times 10^{23}\) particles (Avogadro's number)
- Molar mass: mass of 1 mole of a substance (units: g/mol)
- For elements: molar mass = atomic mass from periodic table
- For compounds: molar mass = sum of atomic masses

**Converting Between Mass, Moles, and Particles**:
\[\text{moles} = \frac{\text{mass (g)}}{\text{molar mass (g/mol)}}\]
\[\text{particles} = \text{moles} \times 6.022 \times 10^{23}\]

**Balancing Chemical Equations**:
- Law of conservation of mass: atoms are neither created nor destroyed
- Coefficients (numbers before formulas) balance the equation
- Example: \(2H_2 + O_2 \rightarrow 2H_2O\)

**Stoichiometric Calculations**:
1. Write and balance the chemical equation
2. Convert given quantity to moles
3. Use mole ratio from balanced equation
4. Convert to desired units

**Limiting Reactant**:
- The reactant that is completely consumed first
- Determines the maximum amount of product that can form
- Excess reactant: the reactant that remains after the reaction

**Percent Yield**:
\[\text{Percent Yield} = \frac{\text{Actual Yield}}{\text{Theoretical Yield}} \times 100\%\]

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: Converting Mass to Moles

**Problem**: How many moles are in 36 grams of water (\(H_2O\))?

**Solution**:
1. Find molar mass of \(H_2O\):
   - H: \(1.0 \text{ g/mol} \times 2 = 2.0 \text{ g/mol}\)
   - O: \(16.0 \text{ g/mol} \times 1 = 16.0 \text{ g/mol}\)
   - Total: \(2.0 + 16.0 = 18.0 \text{ g/mol}\)
2. Use the formula: \(\text{moles} = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{molar mass}}\)
3. \(\text{moles} = \frac{36 \text{ g}}{18.0 \text{ g/mol}} = 2.0 \text{ mol}\)

**Answer**: 2.0 moles of water

### Example 2: Stoichiometric Calculation

**Problem**: Given the reaction \(N_2 + 3H_2 \rightarrow 2NH_3\), how many moles of ammonia (\(NH_3\)) can be produced from 4.0 moles of hydrogen (\(H_2\))?

**Solution**:
1. The balanced equation shows the mole ratio: 3 moles \(H_2\) produces 2 moles \(NH_3\)
2. Set up proportion: \(\frac{3 \text{ mol } H_2}{2 \text{ mol } NH_3} = \frac{4.0 \text{ mol } H_2}{x \text{ mol } NH_3}\)
3. Solve: \(x = \frac{4.0 \text{ mol } H_2 \times 2 \text{ mol } NH_3}{3 \text{ mol } H_2} = \frac{8.0}{3} = 2.67 \text{ mol } NH_3\)

**Answer**: 2.67 moles of ammonia can be produced

### Example 3: Limiting Reactant Problem

**Problem**: For the reaction \(2Mg + O_2 \rightarrow 2MgO\), if you have 4.0 moles of \(Mg\) and 1.5 moles of \(O_2\), which is the limiting reactant? How many moles of \(MgO\) can form?

**Solution**:
1. Calculate how much product each reactant can produce:
2. From \(Mg\): \(4.0 \text{ mol } Mg \times \frac{2 \text{ mol } MgO}{2 \text{ mol } Mg} = 4.0 \text{ mol } MgO\)
3. From \(O_2\): \(1.5 \text{ mol } O_2 \times \frac{2 \text{ mol } MgO}{1 \text{ mol } O_2} = 3.0 \text{ mol } MgO\)
4. \(O_2\) produces less product, so it is the **limiting reactant**
5. Maximum \(MgO\) that can form: 3.0 mol (determined by the limiting reactant)

**Answer**: \(O_2\) is the limiting reactant. 3.0 moles of \(MgO\) can form.

## Answer Key

??? note "Click to reveal answers"
    1. \(CO_2\): \(12.0 + (16.0 \times 2) = 12.0 + 32.0 = \mathbf{44.0 \text{ g/mol}}\)

    2. \(\text{moles} = \frac{88 \text{ g}}{44.0 \text{ g/mol}} = \mathbf{2.0 \text{ mol}}\)

    3. Molar mass of \(NaCl = 23.0 + 35.5 = 58.5 \text{ g/mol}\). Mass \(= 0.50 \text{ mol} \times 58.5 \text{ g/mol} = \mathbf{29.25 \text{ g}}\) or **29.3 g**

    4. \(\mathbf{4Al + 3O_2 \rightarrow 2Al_2O_3}\)

    5. Mole ratio: 2 mol \(H_2\) : 2 mol \(H_2O\) = 1:1. Therefore, \(6.0 \text{ mol } H_2\) produces \(\mathbf{6.0 \text{ mol } H_2O}\)

    6. \(2.0 \text{ mol} \times 6.022 \times 10^{23} \text{ molecules/mol} = \mathbf{1.2 \times 10^{24} \text{ molecules}}\)

    7. From C: \(3.0 \text{ mol } C\) produces \(3.0 \text{ mol } CO_2\). From \(O_2\): \(2.0 \text{ mol } O_2\) produces \(2.0 \text{ mol } CO_2\). **\(O_2\) is the limiting reactant** (produces less product).

    8. Mole ratio: \(4 \text{ mol } Al : 3 \text{ mol } O_2\). So: \(9.0 \text{ mol } O_2 \times \frac{4 \text{ mol } Al}{3 \text{ mol } O_2} = \mathbf{12.0 \text{ mol } Al}\)

    9. \(\frac{42.5 \text{ g}}{50.0 \text{ g}} \times 100\% = \mathbf{85.0\%}\)

    10. Check limiting reactant: From \(N_2\): \(2.0 \times \frac{2}{1} = 4.0\) mol \(NH_3\). From \(H_2\): \(5.0 \times \frac{2}{3} = 3.33\) mol \(NH_3\). \(H_2\) is limiting. **3.33 mol \(NH_3\) can form** (or 3.3 mol rounded).
