# Atomic Structure

## Explanation

Atoms are the fundamental building blocks of matter. Understanding atomic structure is essential for all of chemistry.

### Key Concepts

**Subatomic Particles**:
- **Protons**: Positively charged particles in the nucleus. Atomic number = number of protons.
- **Neutrons**: Neutral particles in the nucleus. Mass number = protons + neutrons.
- **Electrons**: Negatively charged particles orbiting the nucleus in energy levels.

**Atomic Notation**: \(^A_Z X\) where:
- \(X\) = element symbol
- \(Z\) = atomic number (protons)
- \(A\) = mass number (protons + neutrons)

**Isotopes**: Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons.

**Electron Configuration**: Electrons fill energy levels (shells) following the pattern: 2, 8, 8, 18...
- First shell: maximum 2 electrons
- Second shell: maximum 8 electrons
- Third shell: maximum 8 electrons (for first 20 elements)

**Ions**: Atoms that gain or lose electrons become charged:
- **Cations**: Positive ions (lost electrons)
- **Anions**: Negative ions (gained electrons)

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: Determining Atomic Composition

**Problem**: An atom of chlorine has the notation \(^{35}_{17}Cl\). How many protons, neutrons, and electrons does it have?

**Solution**:
1. The atomic number (bottom number) gives protons: \(Z = 17\) protons
2. The mass number (top number) is protons + neutrons: \(A = 35\)
3. Neutrons = \(A - Z = 35 - 17 = 18\) neutrons
4. In a neutral atom, electrons = protons: 17 electrons

**Answer**: 17 protons, 18 neutrons, 17 electrons

### Example 2: Identifying Isotopes

**Problem**: Carbon-12 and Carbon-14 are isotopes. If Carbon-12 has 6 protons and 6 neutrons, how many neutrons does Carbon-14 have? Why are they isotopes?

**Solution**:
1. Both are carbon, so both have 6 protons (atomic number = 6)
2. Carbon-12: mass number = 12, so neutrons = \(12 - 6 = 6\)
3. Carbon-14: mass number = 14, so neutrons = \(14 - 6 = 8\)
4. They are isotopes because they have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons

**Answer**: Carbon-14 has 8 neutrons. They are isotopes because they are the same element (same protons) with different neutron counts.

### Example 3: Electron Configuration and Ion Formation

**Problem**: A sodium atom has 11 electrons with configuration 2, 8, 1. When it forms an ion, it loses one electron. What is the electron configuration of the sodium ion (\(Na^+\))? Why does it lose an electron?

**Solution**:
1. Neutral sodium: 11 electrons with configuration 2, 8, 1
2. When it loses one electron: \(11 - 1 = 10\) electrons
3. New configuration: 2, 8 (the outermost electron is lost)
4. It loses an electron because having 8 electrons in the outer shell is stable (octet rule)
5. The ion has a +1 charge because it lost 1 negative electron

**Answer**: \(Na^+\) has electron configuration 2, 8. It loses an electron to achieve a stable octet in its outer shell.

## Practice Problems

1. An atom has 19 protons, 20 neutrons, and 19 electrons. What is its atomic number, mass number, and element symbol?

2. Write the atomic notation for an atom with 8 protons and 9 neutrons.

3. How many electrons does \(^{23}_{11}Na\) have when it is neutral? How many when it forms \(Na^+\)?

4. Oxygen-16 and Oxygen-18 are isotopes. If both have 8 protons, how many neutrons does each have?

5. An atom of aluminum has 13 electrons. Write its electron configuration using the shell model (e.g., 2, 8, 3).

6. A chloride ion (\(Cl^-\)) has 18 electrons. How many protons does chlorine have? What is its charge?

7. Magnesium (\(Mg\)) has atomic number 12. What is the electron configuration of \(Mg^{2+}\)?

8. An element has the notation \(^{40}_{18}Ar\). Identify the element and state the number of each subatomic particle.

9. Why do atoms of the same element always have the same number of protons but can have different numbers of neutrons?

10. An atom has 17 protons and 18 neutrons. Another atom has 17 protons and 20 neutrons. Are these isotopes? Explain.

## Answer Key

??? note "Click to reveal answers"
    1. **Atomic number = 19** (number of protons), **mass number = 39** (19 + 20), **element = K** (potassium)

    2. \(^{17}_8O\) (oxygen-17)

    3. **Neutral**: 11 electrons. **As \(Na^+\)**: 10 electrons (lost 1 electron)

    4. **Oxygen-16**: \(16 - 8 = 8\) neutrons. **Oxygen-18**: \(18 - 8 = 10\) neutrons

    5. **2, 8, 3** (2 in first shell, 8 in second shell, 3 in third shell)

    6. Chlorine has **17 protons** (neutral Cl has 17 electrons, but \(Cl^-\) has 18). The charge is **-1** (one extra electron).

    7. **2, 8** (lost 2 electrons from the outer shell, 10 electrons remaining)

    8. **Element = Argon (Ar)**. **18 protons, 22 neutrons** (\(40 - 18\)), **18 electrons** (neutral atom)

    9. The number of protons defines the element (atomic number). Atoms of the same element must have the same protons, but neutrons can vary, creating isotopes.

    10. **Yes, they are isotopes**. Both have 17 protons (making them the same element, chlorine), but different neutrons (18 vs 20), which is the definition of isotopes.
