## Explanation

Atoms are the fundamental building blocks of matter. Understanding atomic structure is essential for all of chemistry, from predicting chemical reactions to understanding the properties of elements and compounds.

### Key Concepts

#### Subatomic Particles

**Protons**:
- Positively charged particles (+1 charge) located in the nucleus
- Mass: approximately 1 atomic mass unit (amu)
- The number of protons defines the element's identity
- Atomic number (Z) = number of protons
- **Procedure to find protons**: Look at the atomic number on the periodic table or the subscript in atomic notation

**Neutrons**:
- Neutral particles (no charge) located in the nucleus
- Mass: approximately 1 amu (slightly more than a proton)
- Contribute to atomic mass but not to chemical properties
- **Procedure to find neutrons**:
  1. Identify the mass number (A)
  2. Identify the atomic number (Z)
  3. Calculate: Neutrons = A - Z

**Electrons**:
- Negatively charged particles (-1 charge) orbiting the nucleus
- Mass: approximately 1/2000 amu (negligible compared to protons/neutrons)
- Determine chemical properties and bonding behavior
- In neutral atoms: number of electrons = number of protons
- **Procedure to find electrons in ions**:
  1. Find the number of protons (atomic number)
  2. For cations (positive ions): subtract the charge from protons
  3. For anions (negative ions): add the charge to protons

#### Atomic Notation

The standard atomic notation is: \(^A_Z X\) where:
- \(X\) = element symbol (from periodic table)
- \(Z\) = atomic number (number of protons)
- \(A\) = mass number (protons + neutrons)

**Step-by-step guide to reading atomic notation**:
1. Identify the element symbol (X) to know which element
2. Read the subscript (Z) to find the number of protons
3. Read the superscript (A) to find the total nuclear particles
4. Calculate neutrons: A - Z
5. For neutral atoms, electrons equal Z

#### Isotopes

Isotopes are atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons. They have:
- **Same**: atomic number, number of protons, number of electrons (if neutral), chemical properties
- **Different**: mass number, number of neutrons, atomic mass, nuclear stability

**Procedure to identify isotopes**:
1. Check if atoms have the same atomic number (same element)
2. Check if atoms have different mass numbers
3. If both conditions are met, they are isotopes

**Common isotopes**:
- Carbon-12 and Carbon-14 (used in radiocarbon dating)
- Hydrogen-1, Hydrogen-2 (deuterium), and Hydrogen-3 (tritium)
- Oxygen-16, Oxygen-17, and Oxygen-18

#### Electron Configuration

Electrons occupy energy levels (shells) around the nucleus. Each shell can hold a maximum number of electrons:

**Shell filling pattern**:
1. **First shell (n=1)**: Maximum 2 electrons
2. **Second shell (n=2)**: Maximum 8 electrons
3. **Third shell (n=3)**: Maximum 8 electrons (for elements 1-20)
4. **Fourth shell (n=4)**: Maximum 18 electrons (for heavier elements)

**Step-by-step procedure for electron configuration**:
1. Determine the total number of electrons in the atom/ion
2. Fill the first shell with up to 2 electrons
3. Fill the second shell with up to 8 electrons
4. Fill the third shell with up to 8 electrons (for first 20 elements)
5. Continue filling subsequent shells as needed
6. Write configuration as: 2, 8, 8, etc.

#### Ions

Ions are atoms that have gained or lost electrons, resulting in a net charge:

**Cations (Positive Ions)**:
- Formed when atoms lose electrons
- Typically formed by metals
- Have fewer electrons than protons
- Charge = number of electrons lost
- Example: \(Na^+\) has lost 1 electron

**Anions (Negative Ions)**:
- Formed when atoms gain electrons
- Typically formed by nonmetals
- Have more electrons than protons
- Charge = number of electrons gained
- Example: \(Cl^-\) has gained 1 electron

**Step-by-step procedure to analyze ions**:
1. Identify the neutral atom's number of protons
2. Note the ion charge (positive or negative)
3. For positive charge: subtract charge from protons to get electrons
4. For negative charge: add charge to protons to get electrons
5. Write the new electron configuration

**Why ions form**:
- Atoms form ions to achieve stable electron configurations
- The octet rule: atoms tend to gain or lose electrons to have 8 electrons in their outer shell
- Noble gas configuration: ions often have the same electron configuration as the nearest noble gas

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: Determining Atomic Composition

**Problem**: An atom of chlorine has the notation \(^{35}_{17}Cl\). How many protons, neutrons, and electrons does it have?

**Solution**:

**Step 1**: Identify the atomic number (Z)
- The atomic number is the subscript: \(Z = 17\)
- This tells us there are **17 protons**

**Step 2**: Identify the mass number (A)
- The mass number is the superscript: \(A = 35\)
- This represents the total number of protons and neutrons

**Step 3**: Calculate the number of neutrons
- Use the formula: Neutrons = A - Z
- Neutrons = \(35 - 17 = 18\)
- There are **18 neutrons**

**Step 4**: Determine the number of electrons
- For a neutral atom, electrons = protons
- Since no charge is indicated, the atom is neutral
- There are **17 electrons**

**Answer**: 17 protons, 18 neutrons, 17 electrons

---

### Example 2: Identifying Isotopes

**Problem**: Carbon-12 and Carbon-14 are isotopes. If Carbon-12 has 6 protons and 6 neutrons, how many neutrons does Carbon-14 have? Why are they isotopes?

**Solution**:

**Step 1**: Identify the atomic number
- Both are carbon atoms, so both have the same atomic number
- Carbon's atomic number is 6
- Both have **6 protons**

**Step 2**: Analyze Carbon-12
- The "12" represents the mass number (A = 12)
- Protons = 6, Neutrons = \(12 - 6 = 6\)
- Carbon-12 has **6 neutrons**

**Step 3**: Analyze Carbon-14
- The "14" represents the mass number (A = 14)
- Protons = 6, Neutrons = \(14 - 6 = 8\)
- Carbon-14 has **8 neutrons**

**Step 4**: Explain why they are isotopes
- They have the same number of protons (6) - same element
- They have different numbers of neutrons (6 vs 8) - different mass
- By definition, atoms with the same protons but different neutrons are isotopes

**Answer**: Carbon-14 has 8 neutrons. They are isotopes because they are the same element (same number of protons) but have different numbers of neutrons, resulting in different mass numbers.

### Example 3: Electron Configuration and Ion Formation

**Problem**: A sodium atom has 11 electrons with configuration 2, 8, 1. When it forms an ion, it loses one electron. What is the electron configuration of the sodium ion (\(Na^+\))? Why does it lose an electron?

**Solution**:

**Step 1**: Write the electron configuration of neutral sodium
- Sodium has atomic number 11
- Neutral sodium has 11 electrons
- Configuration: 2, 8, 1
  - First shell: 2 electrons
  - Second shell: 8 electrons
  - Third shell: 1 electron

**Step 2**: Determine which electron is lost
- Electrons are lost from the outermost shell first
- The third shell has 1 electron, which will be lost
- After losing 1 electron: \(11 - 1 = 10\) electrons remain

**Step 3**: Write the new electron configuration
- Remaining electrons: 10
- First shell: 2 electrons
- Second shell: 8 electrons
- Third shell: 0 electrons (removed)
- New configuration: **2, 8**

**Step 4**: Explain why sodium loses an electron
- The octet rule states atoms are stable with 8 electrons in the outer shell
- By losing 1 electron, sodium's outer shell now has 8 electrons (second shell becomes outermost)
- This gives sodium a stable, noble gas configuration (same as neon)
- The resulting ion has a +1 charge (\(Na^+\)) because it lost 1 negative electron

**Step 5**: Verify the charge
- Protons: 11 (unchanged)
- Electrons: 10 (lost 1)
- Net charge: \(11 - 10 = +1\)

**Answer**: \(Na^+\) has electron configuration 2, 8. Sodium loses an electron to achieve a stable octet (8 electrons) in its outer shell, matching the electron configuration of neon, a noble gas.

### Example 4: Working with Mass Number and Isotopes (Multi-Step Problem with Interactive Checker)

**Problem**: An element X has two naturally occurring isotopes. Isotope A has 20 protons and 20 neutrons. Isotope B has the same number of protons but a mass number of 42. Identify the element, write the atomic notation for both isotopes, and determine how many neutrons are in Isotope B.

**Solution**:

**Step 1**: Identify the element
- Atomic number = number of protons = 20
- Looking at the periodic table, element 20 is **Calcium (Ca)**

**Step 2**: Calculate mass number of Isotope A
- Mass number (A) = protons + neutrons
- A = 20 + 20 = **40**

**Step 3**: Write atomic notation for Isotope A
- Format: \(^A_Z X\)
- \(^{40}_{20}Ca\)

**Step 4**: Calculate neutrons in Isotope B
- Given: mass number of Isotope B = 42
- Number of protons = 20 (same element)
- Neutrons = A - Z = 42 - 20 = **22 neutrons**

**Step 5**: Write atomic notation for Isotope B
- \(^{42}_{20}Ca\)

**Answer**: The element is Calcium (Ca). Isotope A: \(^{40}_{20}Ca\) with 20 neutrons. Isotope B: \(^{42}_{20}Ca\) with 22 neutrons. Both isotopes are calcium because they have the same number of protons (20), but they differ in their neutron count.

## Common Mistakes

Understanding where students typically struggle can help you avoid these pitfalls. Here are the most common mistakes in atomic structure:

### Mistake 1: Confusing Mass Number with Atomic Mass

**The Error**: Students often think the mass number and atomic mass are the same thing.

**Why It's Wrong**:
- **Mass number (A)**: A whole number representing the sum of protons and neutrons in a specific isotope
- **Atomic mass**: The weighted average of all isotopes of an element, usually a decimal number found on the periodic table

**Example**: Carbon's atomic mass on the periodic table is 12.01 amu, but Carbon-12 has a mass number of 12, and Carbon-14 has a mass number of 14. The atomic mass (12.01) is closer to 12 because Carbon-12 is more abundant in nature.

**How to Avoid**: Remember that mass number is always a whole number for a specific isotope, while atomic mass considers all isotopes and is typically a decimal.

---

### Mistake 2: Incorrectly Calculating Electrons in Ions

**The Error**: When finding the number of electrons in ions, students sometimes add electrons for cations or subtract for anions (the opposite of what should be done).

**Why It's Wrong**:
- **Cations (positive ions)**: Have LOST electrons, so they have FEWER electrons than protons
- **Anions (negative ions)**: Have GAINED electrons, so they have MORE electrons than protons

**Example**:
- **Incorrect**: Thinking \(Mg^{2+}\) has 14 electrons (12 protons + 2)
- **Correct**: \(Mg^{2+}\) has 10 electrons (12 protons - 2)

**Memory Trick**:
- Positive charge = Fewer electrons (lost electrons, becoming positive)
- Negative charge = More electrons (gained electrons, becoming negative)

**How to Avoid**: Always think about what the charge means. A positive charge means the atom lost negative particles (electrons), so subtract. A negative charge means it gained negative particles, so add.

---

### Mistake 3: Misidentifying Isotopes

**The Error**: Students sometimes think that atoms with different numbers of electrons are isotopes, or that isotopes must have different chemical properties.

**Why It's Wrong**:
- Isotopes differ ONLY in the number of neutrons
- Isotopes have the SAME number of protons and electrons (if neutral)
- Isotopes have nearly identical chemical properties because chemistry depends on electrons, not neutrons
- Atoms with different numbers of electrons are ions, not isotopes

**Example**:
- **Not isotopes**: \(Na\) (11e⁻) and \(Na^+\) (10e⁻) - these are an atom and its ion
- **Are isotopes**: \(^{35}Cl\) and \(^{37}Cl\) - same protons (17), different neutrons (18 vs 20)

**How to Avoid**: Use the checklist:
1. Same element? (same number of protons) → YES required
2. Different mass numbers? (different neutrons) → YES required
3. Same chemical behavior? → YES expected

---

### Mistake 4: Placing Electrons in the Wrong Shells

**The Error**: Students sometimes fill shells incorrectly, such as putting 8 electrons in the first shell or not filling shells in order.

**Why It's Wrong**:
- Each shell has a maximum capacity that cannot be exceeded
- Shells must be filled in order from innermost to outermost
- For elements 1-20: Shell 1 (max 2), Shell 2 (max 8), Shell 3 (max 8)

**Example**:
- **Incorrect**: Oxygen (8e⁻) written as 4, 4 or 2, 2, 4
- **Correct**: Oxygen (8e⁻) should be 2, 6 (fill first shell completely, then second shell)

**Another common error**: Chlorine (17e⁻) written as 2, 8, 8, 1
- **Wrong** because the third shell should only have 7 electrons: 2, 8, 7

**How to Avoid**:
1. Always fill shells in order: 1st → 2nd → 3rd → 4th
2. Don't move to the next shell until the current one is full (or at capacity for that element)
3. Check your total: do the electrons add up correctly?

---

### Mistake 5: Forgetting That Ions Change Electron Count, Not Proton Count

**The Error**: Students sometimes think that forming ions changes the number of protons.

**Why It's Wrong**:
- The number of protons defines the element's identity
- Changing protons would create a different element (nuclear transmutation)
- Ion formation only involves gaining or losing electrons
- The nucleus (protons and neutrons) remains unchanged during chemical processes

**Example**:
- **Incorrect**: Thinking that when Na becomes \(Na^+\), it goes from 11 protons to 12 protons
- **Correct**: Na → \(Na^+\) involves going from 11 electrons to 10 electrons; protons stay at 11

**Why This Matters**: If protons changed, it wouldn't be sodium anymore! An atom with 12 protons is magnesium, not a sodium ion.

**How to Avoid**: Remember this rule: "Protons = Identity". The number of protons never changes in chemical reactions, only in nuclear reactions. Ion charges come only from electron changes.

       - Mass number (A) = 31
       - The atom gains 3 electrons

    2. **Calculate neutrons**:
       - Neutrons = A - Z = 31 - 15 = 16 neutrons

    3. **Calculate electrons in the ion**:
       - Neutral atom would have 15 electrons
       - Gains 3 electrons → 15 + 3 = 18 electrons

    4. **Determine the charge**:
       - Protons = 15 (positive charges)

    ### Problem 4: Answer D

    **Step-by-step solution**:

    1. **Analyze the electron configuration**:
       - Configuration: 2, 8, 7
       - Total electrons = 2 + 8 + 7 = 17 electrons

    2. **Determine atomic number**:
       - For a neutral atom, electrons = protons
       - Atomic number = 17 (this is chlorine)

    3. **Evaluate each statement**:

       **A)** "It has 17 electrons"
       - True ✓ (2 + 8 + 7 = 17)

       **B)** "It has an atomic number of 17"
       - True ✓ (atomic number = number of protons = 17)

       **C)** "It will likely form a -1 ion to achieve stability"
       - True ✓ (needs 1 more electron to complete outer shell → 2, 8, 8)

       **D)** "It has 17 neutrons"
       - **FALSE** ✗ - We can't determine the number of neutrons from electron configuration alone
       - We'd need the mass number to calculate neutrons
       - Chlorine isotopes can have different numbers of neutrons (e.g., Cl-35 has 18 neutrons, Cl-37 has 20 neutrons)

       **E)** "It is likely to gain one electron to complete its outer shell"
       - True ✓ (7 electrons in outer shell, needs 1 more for octet)

    **Answer: D** - The statement "It has 17 neutrons" is FALSE. While we know the atom has 17 protons and 17 electrons, we cannot determine the number of neutrons without knowing the mass number. Different isotopes of chlorine have different numbers of neutrons.

    2. **Compare X and Y**:
       - Same protons (11) → Same element ✓
       - Different neutrons (12 vs 13) → Different mass numbers ✓
       - **X and Y are isotopes** (both are sodium isotopes)

    3. **Compare X and Z**:
       - Different protons (11 vs 12) → Different elements ✗

       - Electron configuration: 2, 8

    3. **Check each option**:

       **A)** Neutral sodium atom (Na, Z=11)
       - 11 electrons, configuration: 2, 8, 1 ✗

       **B)** Neutral neon atom (Ne, Z=10)
       - 10 electrons, configuration: 2, 8 ✓
       - **This matches \(Mg^{2+}\)**

       **C)** Neutral magnesium atom (Mg, Z=12)
       - 12 electrons, configuration: 2, 8, 2 ✗

       **D)** Sodium ion (\(Na^+\), Z=11, lost 1 electron)
       - 10 electrons, configuration: 2, 8 ✓
       - This also matches! But B is listed first

       **E)** Fluoride ion (\(F^-\), Z=9, gained 1 electron)
       - 10 electrons, configuration: 2, 8 ✓
       - This also matches!

    4. **Note about isoelectronic species**:
       - \(Mg^{2+}\), Ne, \(Na^+\), and \(F^-\) are all isoelectronic (same electron configuration)
       - All have 10 electrons with configuration 2, 8
       - Options B, D, and E are technically all correct
       - B is the best answer as it's a neutral noble gas with stable configuration

    **Answer: B** - A neutral neon atom has 10 electrons with configuration 2, 8, which is identical to \(Mg^{2+}\). (Note: \(Na^+\) and \(F^-\) also have this configuration, making them isoelectronic with \(Mg^{2+}\), but neon is the best comparison as it's naturally stable.)

    ### Problem 7: Answer C

    **Step-by-step solution**:

    1. **Identify what the isotopes share**:
       - Element with atomic number 12 (magnesium)
       - Three isotopes: mass numbers 24, 25, and 26

    2. **Analyze statement I - Number of protons**:
       - Atomic number = 12 for all three
       - All isotopes of an element have the same atomic number
       - **All have 12 protons** ✓

    3. **Analyze statement II - Number of neutrons**:
       - Isotope 1: neutrons = 24 - 12 = 12
       - Isotope 2: neutrons = 25 - 12 = 13
       - Isotope 3: neutrons = 26 - 12 = 14
       - **Different numbers of neutrons** ✗
       - This is actually the defining characteristic of isotopes!

    4. **Analyze statement III - Chemical properties**:
       - Chemical properties depend on electron configuration
       - All three isotopes have 12 electrons (neutral atoms)
       - Same electron configuration: 2, 8, 2
       - **Same chemical properties** ✓
       - Isotopes have nearly identical chemical behavior

    5. **Determine which statements are true**:
       - I is true (same protons)
       - II is false (different neutrons)
       - III is true (same chemical properties)
       - Answer: I and III only

    **Answer: C** - Isotopes of the same element always have the same number of protons (I) and the same chemical properties (III) because they have the same electron configuration. They differ only in the number of neutrons (II), which affects mass but not chemical behavior.

    ### Problem 8: Answer E

    **Step-by-step solution**:

    1. **Extract information from atomic notation**:
       - \(^{32}_{16}S\)
       - Atomic number (Z) = 16 → 16 protons
       - Mass number (A) = 32
       - Neutrons = 32 - 16 = 16 (not needed for this problem)

    2. **Determine electrons in the neutral atom**:
       - Neutral sulfur: 16 electrons

    3. **Calculate electrons after gaining 2 electrons**:
       - Gains 2 electrons to form \(S^{2-}\)
       - Electrons in ion = 16 + 2 = 18 electrons

    4. **Verify the charge**:
       - Protons = 16 (never change)
       - Electrons = 18
       - Charge = 16 - 18 = -2 ✓ (sulfide ion, \(S^{2-}\))

    5. **Calculate the ratio**:
       - Ratio of protons to electrons = 16:18
       - Simplify: divide both by 2
       - 16:18 = 8:9

    6. **Check the options**:
       - A) 16:14 - Wrong direction and wrong number
       - B) 16:18 - Correct but not simplified
       - C) 16:16 - This would be a neutral atom
       - D) 18:16 - Backwards (electrons:protons, not protons:electrons)
       - **E) 8:9** - Correct and simplified ✓

    **Answer: E** - The sulfide ion (\(S^{2-}\)) has 16 protons and 18 electrons, giving a ratio of 16:18, which simplifies to 8:9. Remember that gaining electrons creates a negative charge because electrons are negatively charged.

    ### Problem 9: Answer B

    **Step-by-step solution**:

    1. **Analyze the electron configuration**:
       - Configuration: 2, 8, 8, 2
       - Total electrons = 2 + 8 + 8 + 2 = 20 electrons
       - This is a neutral atom with 20 protons (calcium, Ca)

    2. **Evaluate each statement**:

       **A)** "It has a mass number of 20"
       - FALSE - Mass number = protons + neutrons
       - We can't determine mass number from electron configuration
       - We only know it has 20 protons; neutrons are unknown ✗

       **B)** "It will likely lose 2 electrons to form a cation"
       - TRUE - The outer shell has only 2 electrons
       - Losing 2 electrons gives configuration 2, 8, 8 (stable octet in outer shell)
       - Forms \(Ca^{2+}\) with noble gas configuration ✓

       **C)** "It has 18 protons"
       - FALSE - It has 20 protons (atomic number = 20) ✗

       **D)** "It is a noble gas"
       - FALSE - Noble gases have full outer shells (8 electrons for most)
       - This atom has only 2 electrons in its outer shell ✗

       **E)** "It will likely gain 6 electrons to complete its outer shell"
       - FALSE - Gaining 6 electrons is energetically unfavorable
       - It's much easier to lose 2 electrons than gain 6 ✗
       - Metals (like calcium) lose electrons, not gain them

    3. **Confirm the answer**:
       - Only statement B is true
       - Calcium readily forms \(Ca^{2+}\) by losing 2 electrons

    **Answer: B** - The atom (calcium) will likely lose 2 electrons to form a cation (\(Ca^{2+}\)). With 2 electrons in its outer shell, it's much more favorable to lose those 2 electrons to achieve a stable octet (2, 8, 8) than to gain 6 electrons to fill the fourth shell.

    ### Problem 10: Answer A

    **Step-by-step solution**:

    1. **Organize the given information**:
       - Both atoms have 17 protons (chlorine, Cl)
       - **Atom A**: 18 neutrons, 18 electrons
       - **Atom B**: 20 neutrons, 17 electrons

    2. **Determine the charge of Atom A**:
       - Protons = 17, Electrons = 18
       - More electrons than protons → negative charge
       - Charge = 17 - 18 = -1
       - **Atom A is an anion** (\(Cl^-\))

    3. **Determine the charge of Atom B**:
       - Protons = 17, Electrons = 17
       - Equal protons and electrons → no charge
       - **Atom B is neutral** (Cl)

    4. **Determine if they are isotopes**:
       - Both have 17 protons → Same element (chlorine) ✓
       - Atom A has 18 neutrons, Atom B has 20 neutrons → Different neutrons ✓
       - **They are isotopes** (Cl-35 ion and Cl-37 neutral atom)

    5. **Evaluate the answer choices**:
       - **A)** A is an anion ✓, B is neutral ✓, they are isotopes ✓ - **All correct**
       - B) A is an anion ✓, B is neutral ✓, but they ARE isotopes ✗
       - C) A is a cation ✗ (it's an anion)
       - D) They are not the same atom ✗ (different neutrons and electrons)
       - E) A is not neutral ✗ (it's an anion)

    6. **Important concept**:
       - An ion can be an isotope of a neutral atom
       - Isotopes only require same protons, different neutrons
       - The electron count doesn't matter for isotope classification

    **Answer: A** - Atom A is an anion (\(Cl^-\)) with 18 neutrons, and Atom B is a neutral atom with 20 neutrons. They are isotopes because they have the same number of protons (17) but different numbers of neutrons. The fact that one is an ion and one is neutral doesn't change their isotope relationship.
