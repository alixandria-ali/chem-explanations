# States of Matter

## Explanation

Matter exists in different physical states based on the arrangement and energy of its particles. Understanding states of matter helps explain physical properties and phase changes.

### Key Concepts

**Three States of Matter**:

**Solid**:
- Particles closely packed in fixed positions
- Vibrate in place but don't move around
- Definite shape and definite volume
- Incompressible
- Examples: ice, iron, salt

**Liquid**:
- Particles close together but can slide past each other
- Takes the shape of its container
- Definite volume but no definite shape
- Incompressible
- Examples: water, oil, mercury

**Gas**:
- Particles far apart and move freely at high speeds
- Fills the entire volume of its container
- No definite shape or volume
- Compressible
- Examples: air, helium, water vapor

**Kinetic Molecular Theory**:
- All matter is made of particles in constant motion
- Temperature is a measure of average kinetic energy
- Higher temperature = faster particle motion
- Explains properties of each state

**Phase Changes**:
- **Melting**: solid → liquid (requires energy)
- **Freezing**: liquid → solid (releases energy)
- **Vaporization/Boiling**: liquid → gas (requires energy)
- **Condensation**: gas → liquid (releases energy)
- **Sublimation**: solid → gas (requires energy)
- **Deposition**: gas → solid (releases energy)

**Energy and Phase Changes**:
- Endothermic: absorbs heat (melting, vaporization, sublimation)
- Exothermic: releases heat (freezing, condensation, deposition)
- During a phase change, temperature remains constant while energy goes into changing state

**Heating Curve**: Graph showing temperature vs. heat added:
- Diagonal sections: temperature increases (kinetic energy increases)
- Flat sections: phase change occurs (potential energy changes, temperature constant)

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: Identifying States and Properties

**Problem**: Compare the properties of water in its three states: ice (solid), liquid water, and water vapor (gas). Describe the particle arrangement and motion in each.

**Solution**:
1. **Ice (solid)**:
   - Arrangement: \(H_2O\) molecules in fixed, ordered crystal structure
   - Motion: molecules vibrate in place
   - Properties: definite shape and volume, rigid
2. **Liquid water**:
   - Arrangement: molecules close together but not fixed
   - Motion: molecules slide past each other
   - Properties: takes container shape, definite volume
3. **Water vapor (gas)**:
   - Arrangement: molecules far apart, no pattern
   - Motion: molecules move rapidly and randomly
   - Properties: fills container completely, no definite shape or volume

**Answer**: Ice has fixed, ordered particle arrangement with vibration only. Liquid water has close but mobile particles. Water vapor has widely separated, rapidly moving particles.

### Example 2: Phase Changes and Energy

**Problem**: Identify the phase change and whether it is endothermic or exothermic:
(a) Dew forming on grass in the morning
(b) Ice melting on a warm day
(c) Dry ice (solid \(CO_2\)) turning directly to gas

**Solution**:
1. (a) Dew forming: water vapor (gas) → liquid water
   - Phase change: **condensation**
   - Gas → liquid releases energy: **exothermic**
2. (b) Ice melting: solid → liquid
   - Phase change: **melting**
   - Solid → liquid requires energy: **endothermic**
3. (c) Dry ice to gas: solid → gas (skips liquid)
   - Phase change: **sublimation**
   - Solid → gas requires energy: **endothermic**

**Answer**: (a) condensation, exothermic; (b) melting, endothermic; (c) sublimation, endothermic

### Example 3: Interpreting a Heating Curve

**Problem**: A heating curve for water shows temperature vs. heat added. There's a flat section at 0°C and another at 100°C. Explain what is happening during these flat sections.

**Solution**:
1. **Flat section at 0°C**:
   - Ice is melting to liquid water
   - Energy goes into breaking bonds (increasing potential energy)
   - Temperature stays at 0°C until all ice melts
   - This is the **melting point**
2. **Flat section at 100°C**:
   - Liquid water is boiling to water vapor
   - Energy goes into breaking intermolecular forces (increasing potential energy)
   - Temperature stays at 100°C until all liquid vaporizes
   - This is the **boiling point**
3. During phase changes, added energy changes the state (potential energy) rather than temperature (kinetic energy)

**Answer**: At 0°C, ice melts to water (melting). At 100°C, water boils to vapor (vaporization). Temperature remains constant during phase changes while energy breaks intermolecular forces.

## Answer Key

??? note "Click to reveal answers"
    1. **Solids** have particles closest together. **Gases** have particles that move the fastest (highest kinetic energy).

    2. **Gases are compressible** because particles are far apart with lots of empty space. **Solids and liquids are incompressible** because particles are already close together with minimal space between them.

    3. (a) **Deposition** (gas → solid), (b) **Vaporization/evaporation** (liquid → gas), (c) **Freezing/solidification** (liquid → solid)

    4. **Endothermic**. Boiling requires energy input to overcome intermolecular forces and convert liquid to gas.

    5. **50°C**: liquid. **-10°C**: solid (ice). **150°C**: gas (water vapor/steam).

    6. During boiling (phase change), the added heat energy goes into **breaking intermolecular forces** (changing potential energy) rather than increasing temperature (kinetic energy). Temperature stays constant until the phase change is complete.

    7. **Water vapor at 100°C** contains more energy. It has the same kinetic energy (same temperature) but also contains the energy that was absorbed during vaporization (heat of vaporization).

    8. Kinetic energy **decreases** as the gas cools. When particles slow down enough, intermolecular forces can hold them closer together, causing condensation to liquid.

    9. Diagonal sections represent **temperature changes** within a single state. During these sections, added heat increases the kinetic energy (and thus temperature) of particles.

    10. In ice, \(H_2O\) molecules form a **rigid crystal structure with open spaces**, making ice less dense than liquid water. In liquid water, molecules are closer together on average. Because ice is less dense, it floats on liquid water (density principle: less dense floats on more dense).
