# Chemical Bonding

## Explanation

Chemical bonds form when atoms share or transfer electrons to achieve stable electron configurations. Understanding bonding helps explain the properties of compounds.

### Key Concepts

**Types of Bonds**:

**Ionic Bonds**:
- Form between metals and nonmetals
- Electrons are **transferred** from metal to nonmetal
- Metal becomes a positive cation; nonmetal becomes a negative anion
- Electrostatic attraction between opposite charges holds ions together
- Example: $NaCl$ (sodium chloride)
- Properties: High melting points, conduct electricity when dissolved or molten, form crystalline solids

**Covalent Bonds**:
- Form between nonmetals
- Electrons are **shared** between atoms
- Single bond: 1 pair shared; Double bond: 2 pairs shared; Triple bond: 3 pairs shared
- Example: $H_2O$ (water), $O_2$ (oxygen gas)
- Properties: Lower melting points than ionic, usually don't conduct electricity, can be solid, liquid, or gas

**Metallic Bonds**:
- Form between metal atoms
- Electrons are **delocalized** (mobile "sea of electrons")
- Allows metals to conduct electricity and be malleable/ductile
- Example: Copper (Cu), iron (Fe)

**Lewis Dot Structures**:
- Show valence electrons as dots around element symbols
- Help predict bonding and molecular structure
- Example: $H \cdot$ has 1 dot, $\ddot{O}\!\!:$ has 6 dots

**Octet Rule**: Atoms tend to gain, lose, or share electrons to achieve 8 valence electrons (stable configuration like noble gases). Exception: Hydrogen aims for 2 electrons.

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: Predicting Bond Type

**Problem**: Predict whether the following compounds have ionic or covalent bonds:
(a) $MgO$ (magnesium oxide)
(b) $CO_2$ (carbon dioxide)
(c) $KBr$ (potassium bromide)

**Solution**:
1. Ionic bonds form between metals and nonmetals; covalent bonds form between nonmetals
2. (a) $MgO$: Mg is a metal (Group 2), O is a nonmetal (Group 16) → **ionic**
3. (b) $CO_2$: C is a nonmetal, O is a nonmetal → **covalent**
4. (c) $KBr$: K is a metal (Group 1), Br is a nonmetal (Group 17) → **ionic**

**Answer**: (a) ionic, (b) covalent, (c) ionic

### Example 2: Drawing Lewis Structures

**Problem**: Draw the Lewis dot structure for water ($H_2O$). Show how the octet rule is satisfied for oxygen.

**Solution**:
1. Count valence electrons: H has 1 (× 2 = 2), O has 6. Total = 8 electrons
2. O is the central atom (less electronegative than would be expected, but H can only form 1 bond)
3. Connect each H to O with a single bond (uses 4 electrons)
4. Place remaining 4 electrons as 2 lone pairs on O
5. Lewis structure:
   ```
      H-O-H  with two lone pairs on O
      or:  H:O:H
           ..
   ```
6. O has 2 bonding pairs + 2 lone pairs = 8 electrons (octet satisfied)
7. Each H has 2 electrons (duet satisfied)

**Answer**: Water has two O-H single bonds with two lone pairs on oxygen. Oxygen satisfies the octet rule with 8 electrons total.

### Example 3: Ionic Compound Formation

**Problem**: When sodium (Na) reacts with chlorine (Cl) to form $NaCl$, describe the electron transfer. What are the charges of the resulting ions?

**Solution**:
1. Na (Group 1): 11 electrons, configuration 2, 8, 1
2. Cl (Group 17): 17 electrons, configuration 2, 8, 7
3. Na loses 1 electron to achieve stable octet: $Na \rightarrow Na^+ + e^-$
4. Resulting $Na^+$: 10 electrons, configuration 2, 8
5. Cl gains 1 electron to achieve stable octet: $Cl + e^- \rightarrow Cl^-$
6. Resulting $Cl^-$: 18 electrons, configuration 2, 8, 8
7. Ionic compound forms: $Na^+ Cl^-$ (neutral overall)

**Answer**: Na loses 1 electron to form $Na^+$ (charge: +1). Cl gains 1 electron to form $Cl^-$ (charge: -1). The ionic bond forms between $Na^+$ and $Cl^-$.

## Answer Key

??? note "Click to reveal answers"
    1. (a) **ionic** (Ca is metal, F is nonmetal), (b) **covalent** (both nonmetals), (c) **covalent** (both nonmetals), (d) **ionic** (Li is metal, Cl is nonmetal)

    2. Ionic compounds have **strong electrostatic forces** between oppositely charged ions arranged in a crystal lattice. Large amounts of energy are needed to break these forces, resulting in high melting points.

    3. Carbon has **4 valence electrons** and typically forms **4 covalent bonds** to achieve an octet.

    4. $Cl-Cl$ with 3 lone pairs on each Cl atom. Each Cl has **8 electrons** (1 bonding pair + 3 lone pairs = 8 electrons, satisfying the octet rule).

    5. $Mg^{2+}$ (charge: +2). Magnesium has 2 valence electrons and loses both to achieve a stable octet (configuration 2, 8).

    6. **Metallic bonding**. Copper conducts electricity because the electrons are delocalized and can move freely through the metal structure.

    7. $CaBr_2$. Calcium forms $Ca^{2+}$ and bromine forms $Br^-$. To balance charges, you need 2 bromide ions for each calcium ion.

    8. Nonmetals have **high electronegativity** and tend to gain electrons. When two nonmetals react, neither can easily give up electrons, so they **share electrons** instead, forming covalent bonds.

    9. N is central, bonded to 3 H atoms, with 1 lone pair on N. N has 3 bonding pairs + 1 lone pair = 8 electrons. **Yes, nitrogen satisfies the octet rule**.

    10. $NaCl$ has a **much higher melting point** (801°C vs 0°C). Ionic bonds are much stronger than the intermolecular forces between covalent molecules, requiring more energy to break.
