# Electrochemistry

## Explanation

Electrochemistry studies the relationship between chemical reactions and electrical energy. It includes both spontaneous reactions (batteries) and non-spontaneous reactions driven by electricity (electrolysis).

### Key Concepts

**Oxidation-Reduction (Redox) Reactions**:
- **Oxidation**: Loss of electrons (increase in oxidation number)
- **Reduction**: Gain of electrons (decrease in oxidation number)
- **OIL RIG**: Oxidation Is Loss, Reduction Is Gain
- Redox reactions always occur together: one species oxidized, one reduced

**Oxidation Numbers**:
- Rules for assigning:
  - Free elements: 0
  - Monatomic ions: charge of ion
  - O: usually -2
  - H: usually +1
  - Sum of oxidation numbers = charge of species

**Half-Reactions**:
- Separate oxidation and reduction processes
- Example: $Zn + Cu^{2+} \rightarrow Zn^{2+} + Cu$
  - Oxidation: $Zn \rightarrow Zn^{2+} + 2e^-$
  - Reduction: $Cu^{2+} + 2e^- \rightarrow Cu$

**Galvanic (Voltaic) Cells**:
- Spontaneous redox reaction produces electrical energy
- **Anode**: Oxidation occurs (negative electrode)
- **Cathode**: Reduction occurs (positive electrode)
- Electrons flow from anode to cathode through external circuit
- Salt bridge maintains charge balance
- Example: batteries

**Standard Reduction Potentials ($E°$)**:
- Measure tendency to gain electrons (be reduced)
- Standard conditions: 25°C, 1 M, 1 atm
- More positive $E°$ = stronger oxidizing agent
- Cell potential: $E°_{\text{cell}} = E°_{\text{cathode}} - E°_{\text{anode}}$
- Spontaneous if $E°_{\text{cell}} > 0$

**Electrolytic Cells**:
- Non-spontaneous redox driven by external electricity
- Used for electroplating, decomposition, refining metals
- Example: Electrolysis of water: $2H_2O \rightarrow 2H_2 + O_2$

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: Identifying Oxidation and Reduction

**Problem**: For the reaction $Mg + 2HCl \rightarrow MgCl_2 + H_2$, identify what is oxidized and what is reduced.

**Solution**:
1. Assign oxidation numbers:
   - Reactants: $Mg = 0$, $H = +1$ (in $HCl$), $Cl = -1$
   - Products: $Mg = +2$ (in $MgCl_2$), $Cl = -1$, $H = 0$ (in $H_2$)
2. Changes:
   - $Mg$: $0 \rightarrow +2$ (lost 2 electrons) → **oxidized**
   - $H$: $+1 \rightarrow 0$ (gained 1 electron) → **reduced**
3. $Mg$ is the reducing agent (gets oxidized)
4. $HCl$ (specifically $H^+$) is the oxidizing agent (gets reduced)

**Answer**: Mg is oxidized; H$^+$ is reduced

### Example 2: Writing Half-Reactions

**Problem**: Write the oxidation and reduction half-reactions for:
$$Fe + Cu^{2+} \rightarrow Fe^{2+} + Cu$$

**Solution**:
1. Identify oxidation number changes:
   - $Fe$: $0 \rightarrow +2$ (loses 2 electrons, oxidized)
   - $Cu^{2+}$: $+2 \rightarrow 0$ (gains 2 electrons, reduced)
2. Write half-reactions:
   - Oxidation: $Fe \rightarrow Fe^{2+} + 2e^-$
   - Reduction: $Cu^{2+} + 2e^- \rightarrow Cu$
3. Check: electrons balance (2 on each side)

**Answer**:
- Oxidation: $Fe \rightarrow Fe^{2+} + 2e^-$
- Reduction: $Cu^{2+} + 2e^- \rightarrow Cu$

### Example 3: Calculating Cell Potential

**Problem**: Calculate $E°_{\text{cell}}$ for a galvanic cell with these half-reactions:
- $Zn^{2+} + 2e^- \rightarrow Zn \quad E° = -0.76 \text{ V}$
- $Cu^{2+} + 2e^- \rightarrow Cu \quad E° = +0.34 \text{ V}$

Which is the anode and which is the cathode?

**Solution**:
1. The more positive $E°$ is reduced (cathode): $Cu^{2+} \rightarrow Cu$ (cathode)
2. The less positive $E°$ is oxidized (anode): $Zn \rightarrow Zn^{2+}$ (anode)
3. Calculate cell potential: $E°_{\text{cell}} = E°_{\text{cathode}} - E°_{\text{anode}}$
4. $E°_{\text{cell}} = (+0.34) - (-0.76) = +0.34 + 0.76 = +1.10 \text{ V}$
5. Since $E°_{\text{cell}} > 0$, reaction is spontaneous

**Answer**: $E°_{\text{cell}} = +1.10 \text{ V}$. Cu is cathode (reduction), Zn is anode (oxidation). Reaction is spontaneous.

## Answer Key

??? note "Click to reveal answers"
    1. **Oxidation**: Loss of electrons (species becomes more positive). **Reduction**: Gain of electrons (species becomes more negative/less positive).

    2. $Na$: $0 \rightarrow +1$ (**oxidized**). $Cl$: $0 \rightarrow -1$ (**reduced**).

    3. (a) $H_2SO_4$: H = +1, S = +6, O = -2. (b) $NO_3^-$: N = +5, O = -2. (c) $MnO_4^-$: Mn = +7, O = -2.

    4. **Oxidation**: $Al \rightarrow Al^{3+} + 3e^-$ (multiply by 2). **Reduction**: $Cu^{2+} + 2e^- \rightarrow Cu$ (multiply by 3). Balanced: $2Al \rightarrow 2Al^{3+} + 6e^-$ and $3Cu^{2+} + 6e^- \rightarrow 3Cu$.

    5. The **anode is negative** (in galvanic cells). **Oxidation occurs at the anode**.

    6. Ag has more positive $E°$, so it's reduced (cathode). Zn is oxidized (anode). $E°_{\text{cell}} = (+0.80) - (-0.76) = \mathbf{+1.56 \text{ V}}$.

    7. **Non-spontaneous**. Negative $E°_{\text{cell}}$ means the reaction requires external energy input.

    8. The salt bridge **maintains electrical neutrality** by allowing ions to flow between half-cells, completing the circuit without allowing solutions to mix.

    9. **Galvanic cell**: Spontaneous redox reaction produces electricity (battery). **Electrolytic cell**: External electricity drives non-spontaneous redox reaction (electrolysis).

    10. **Cathode** produces sodium metal (reduction occurs at cathode). Half-reaction: $\mathbf{Na^+ + e^- \rightarrow Na}$.
