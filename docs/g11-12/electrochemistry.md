# Electrochemistry

## Explanation

Electrochemistry studies the relationship between chemical reactions and electrical energy. It includes both spontaneous reactions (batteries) and non-spontaneous reactions driven by electricity (electrolysis).

### Key Concepts

**Oxidation-Reduction (Redox) Reactions**:
- **Oxidation**: Loss of electrons (increase in oxidation number)
- **Reduction**: Gain of electrons (decrease in oxidation number)
- **OIL RIG**: Oxidation Is Loss, Reduction Is Gain
- Redox reactions always occur together: one species oxidized, one reduced

**Step-by-Step Guide to Identifying Redox Reactions**:

1. **Assign oxidation numbers** to all atoms in reactants and products
   - Free elements: 0 (e.g., \(H_2\), \(O_2\), \(Na\))
   - Monatomic ions: charge of ion (e.g., \(Na^+ = +1\), \(Cl^- = -1\))
   - Oxygen: usually -2 (except in peroxides: -1)
   - Hydrogen: usually +1 (except in metal hydrides: -1)
   - Sum of oxidation numbers = total charge of species

2. **Identify changes** in oxidation numbers
   - Increase in oxidation number = oxidation (loss of electrons)
   - Decrease in oxidation number = reduction (gain of electrons)

3. **Determine oxidizing and reducing agents**
   - Species that gets oxidized = reducing agent (causes reduction)
   - Species that gets reduced = oxidizing agent (causes oxidation)

4. **Write half-reactions** to show electron transfer clearly
   - Oxidation half-reaction: shows electron loss
   - Reduction half-reaction: shows electron gain
   - Electrons must balance between the two half-reactions

**Oxidation Numbers**:
- Rules for assigning:
  - Free elements: 0
  - Monatomic ions: charge of ion
  - O: usually -2
  - H: usually +1
  - Sum of oxidation numbers = charge of species

**Half-Reactions**:
- Separate oxidation and reduction processes
- Example: \(Zn + Cu^{2+} \rightarrow Zn^{2+} + Cu\)
  - Oxidation: \(Zn \rightarrow Zn^{2+} + 2e^-\)
  - Reduction: \(Cu^{2+} + 2e^- \rightarrow Cu\)

**Step-by-Step Guide to Writing Half-Reactions**:

1. **Write the skeleton equation** showing only the species being oxidized or reduced
2. **Balance atoms** other than O and H
3. **Balance oxygen** by adding \(H_2O\)
4. **Balance hydrogen** by adding \(H^+\) (in acidic solution) or \(OH^-\) (in basic solution)
5. **Balance charge** by adding electrons
6. **Check your work**: atoms and charge should balance

**Galvanic (Voltaic) Cells**:
- Spontaneous redox reaction produces electrical energy
- **Anode**: Oxidation occurs (negative electrode)
- **Cathode**: Reduction occurs (positive electrode)
- Electrons flow from anode to cathode through external circuit
- Salt bridge maintains charge balance
- Example: batteries

**Standard Reduction Potentials (\(E°\))**:
- Measure tendency to gain electrons (be reduced)
- Standard conditions: 25°C, 1 M, 1 atm
- More positive \(E°\) = stronger oxidizing agent
- Cell potential: \(E°_{\text{cell}} = E°_{\text{cathode}} - E°_{\text{anode}}\)
- Spontaneous if \(E°_{\text{cell}} > 0\)

**Step-by-Step Guide to Calculating Cell Potential**:

1. **Identify the two half-reactions** and their standard reduction potentials
2. **Determine which species is reduced** (higher/more positive \(E°\)) = cathode
3. **Determine which species is oxidized** (lower/more negative \(E°\)) = anode
4. **Apply the formula**: \(E°_{\text{cell}} = E°_{\text{cathode}} - E°_{\text{anode}}\)
   - Note: Use the reduction potential as written for BOTH, even though one is reversed
5. **Check spontaneity**: If \(E°_{\text{cell}} > 0\), reaction is spontaneous
6. **Verify your work**:
   - Cathode should have more positive \(E°\)
   - Cell potential should be positive for spontaneous reactions

**Electrolytic Cells**:
- Non-spontaneous redox driven by external electricity
- Used for electroplating, decomposition, refining metals
- Example: Electrolysis of water: \(2H_2O \rightarrow 2H_2 + O_2\)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Getting the Sign Wrong on Oxidation Numbers
**Error**: Assigning +2 to oxygen in \(CO_2\) instead of -2

**Why it's wrong**: Oxygen almost always has an oxidation number of -2 (except in peroxides like \(H_2O_2\) where it's -1, or in \(OF_2\) where it's +2). This is a fundamental rule.

**Correct approach**: In \(CO_2\), oxygen is -2, so carbon must be +4 to make the sum equal to 0 (the charge of the molecule).

### Mistake 2: Confusing Anode and Cathode in Galvanic vs. Electrolytic Cells
**Error**: Thinking the anode is always positive

**Why it's wrong**: The anode's charge depends on the type of cell:
- **Galvanic cell**: Anode is negative (oxidation produces electrons here)
- **Electrolytic cell**: Anode is positive (connected to positive terminal of battery)

**Correct approach**: Remember AN-OX and RED-CAT (Anode = Oxidation, Cathode = Reduction) works for BOTH types of cells. The charge depends on cell type.

### Mistake 3: Subtracting Cell Potentials Incorrectly
**Error**: Calculating \(E°_{\text{cell}} = E°_{\text{oxidation}} - E°_{\text{reduction}}\)

**Why it's wrong**: The formula is \(E°_{\text{cell}} = E°_{\text{cathode}} - E°_{\text{anode}}\), where BOTH values are reduction potentials as given in tables. You don't flip the sign of the oxidation potential.

**Correct approach**:
1. Identify which species is reduced (cathode) and which is oxidized (anode)
2. Use: \(E°_{\text{cell}} = E°_{\text{cathode}} - E°_{\text{anode}}\)
3. Both values come from the reduction potential table without changing signs

Example: If \(E°_{\text{cathode}} = +0.34\) V and \(E°_{\text{anode}} = -0.76\) V
\(E°_{\text{cell}} = 0.34 - (-0.76) = +1.10\) V

### Mistake 4: Forgetting to Balance Electrons in Half-Reactions
**Error**: Adding half-reactions without balancing electrons first

**Why it's wrong**: The number of electrons lost in oxidation must equal the number gained in reduction. If electrons don't balance, the overall equation will be incorrect.

**Correct approach**:
- Write both half-reactions
- Multiply each by factors to make electrons equal
- Then add them together, canceling electrons

Example:
- Oxidation: \(Al \rightarrow Al^{3+} + 3e^-\) (multiply by 2)
- Reduction: \(Cu^{2+} + 2e^- \rightarrow Cu\) (multiply by 3)
- Result: 6 electrons on each side, which cancel out

### Mistake 5: Misidentifying the Oxidizing and Reducing Agents
**Error**: Saying the oxidizing agent is the species that gets oxidized

**Why it's wrong**: The oxidizing agent CAUSES oxidation (but is itself reduced). The reducing agent CAUSES reduction (but is itself oxidized).

**Correct approach**:
- **Oxidizing agent** = species that gets REDUCED (gains electrons)
- **Reducing agent** = species that gets OXIDIZED (loses electrons)
- Think of it like this: The oxidizing agent "oxidizes" other things but gets reduced itself

---

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: Identifying Oxidation and Reduction

**Problem**: For the reaction \(Mg + 2HCl \rightarrow MgCl_2 + H_2\), identify what is oxidized and what is reduced.

**Solution**:
1. Assign oxidation numbers:
   - Reactants: \(Mg = 0\), \(H = +1\) (in \(HCl\)), \(Cl = -1\)
   - Products: \(Mg = +2\) (in \(MgCl_2\)), \(Cl = -1\), \(H = 0\) (in \(H_2\))
2. Changes:
   - \(Mg\): \(0 \rightarrow +2\) (lost 2 electrons) → **oxidized**
   - \(H\): \(+1 \rightarrow 0\) (gained 1 electron) → **reduced**
3. \(Mg\) is the reducing agent (gets oxidized)
4. \(HCl\) (specifically \(H^+\)) is the oxidizing agent (gets reduced)

**Answer**: Mg is oxidized; H\(^+\) is reduced

---

### Example 2: Writing Half-Reactions

**Problem**: Write the oxidation and reduction half-reactions for:
\[Fe + Cu^{2+} \rightarrow Fe^{2+} + Cu\]

**Solution**:
1. Identify oxidation number changes:
   - \(Fe\): \(0 \rightarrow +2\) (loses 2 electrons, oxidized)
   - \(Cu^{2+}\): \(+2 \rightarrow 0\) (gains 2 electrons, reduced)
2. Write half-reactions:
   - Oxidation: \(Fe \rightarrow Fe^{2+} + 2e^-\)
   - Reduction: \(Cu^{2+} + 2e^- \rightarrow Cu\)
3. Check: electrons balance (2 on each side)

**Answer**:
- Oxidation: \(Fe \rightarrow Fe^{2+} + 2e^-\)
- Reduction: \(Cu^{2+} + 2e^- \rightarrow Cu\)

---

### Example 3: Calculating Cell Potential

**Problem**: Calculate \(E°_{\text{cell}}\) for a galvanic cell with these half-reactions:
- \(Zn^{2+} + 2e^- \rightarrow Zn \quad E° = -0.76 \text{ V}\)
- \(Cu^{2+} + 2e^- \rightarrow Cu \quad E° = +0.34 \text{ V}\)

Which is the anode and which is the cathode?

**Solution**:
1. The more positive \(E°\) is reduced (cathode): \(Cu^{2+} \rightarrow Cu\) (cathode)
2. The less positive \(E°\) is oxidized (anode): \(Zn \rightarrow Zn^{2+}\) (anode)
3. Calculate cell potential: \(E°_{\text{cell}} = E°_{\text{cathode}} - E°_{\text{anode}}\)
4. \(E°_{\text{cell}} = (+0.34) - (-0.76) = +0.34 + 0.76 = +1.10 \text{ V}\)
5. Since \(E°_{\text{cell}} > 0\), reaction is spontaneous

**Answer**: \(E°_{\text{cell}} = +1.10 \text{ V}\). Cu is cathode (reduction), Zn is anode (oxidation). Reaction is spontaneous.

## Step Checker: Cell Potential Calculation

Use this interactive checker to verify your cell potential calculations step by step.

**Given Information**:
- Half-reaction 1: \(Ag^+ + e^- \rightarrow Ag\) with \(E° = +0.80\) V
- Half-reaction 2: \(Ni^{2+} + 2e^- \rightarrow Ni\) with \(E° = -0.25\) V

**Step 1**: Identify which species will be reduced (cathode)
??? check "Check your answer"
    The species with the MORE POSITIVE \(E°\) will be reduced.

    \(E°_{Ag^+/Ag} = +0.80\) V (more positive)

    \(E°_{Ni^{2+}/Ni} = -0.25\) V (less positive)

    Therefore, **Ag+ will be reduced at the cathode**.

**Step 2**: Identify which species will be oxidized (anode)
??? check "Check your answer"
    The species with the LESS POSITIVE (or more negative) \(E°\) will be oxidized.

    Therefore, **Ni will be oxidized at the anode**.

    The half-reaction will be reversed: \(Ni \rightarrow Ni^{2+} + 2e^-\)

**Step 3**: Write the cell notation
??? check "Check your answer"
    Anode || Cathode

    \(Ni | Ni^{2+} || Ag^+ | Ag\)

**Step 4**: Calculate \(E°_{\text{cell}}\)
??? check "Check your answer"
    Use the formula: \(E°_{\text{cell}} = E°_{\text{cathode}} - E°_{\text{anode}}\)

    \(E°_{\text{cell}} = (+0.80) - (-0.25)\)

    \(E°_{\text{cell}} = +0.80 + 0.25\)

    \(E°_{\text{cell}} = +1.05\) V

**Step 5**: Determine if the reaction is spontaneous
??? check "Check your answer"
    Since \(E°_{\text{cell}} = +1.05\) V > 0, the reaction is **SPONTANEOUS**.

    This can occur in a galvanic (voltaic) cell and will produce electrical energy.

**Step 6**: Write the balanced overall equation
??? check "Check your answer"
    Balance electrons first:
    - Oxidation: \(Ni \rightarrow Ni^{2+} + 2e^-\) (already has 2e-)
    - Reduction: \(Ag^+ + e^- \rightarrow Ag\) (multiply by 2)

    Balanced half-reactions:
    - Oxidation: \(Ni \rightarrow Ni^{2+} + 2e^-\)
    - Reduction: \(2Ag^+ + 2e^- \rightarrow 2Ag\)

    Overall: \(Ni + 2Ag^+ \rightarrow Ni^{2+} + 2Ag\)

## SAT Chemistry Problems

### Problem 1
In the reaction \(2Al + 3CuSO_4 \rightarrow Al_2(SO_4)_3 + 3Cu\), which statement is correct?

(A) Aluminum is reduced and copper is oxidized
(B) Aluminum is oxidized and copper is reduced
(C) Aluminum is the oxidizing agent
(D) Copper ions gain 3 electrons each
(E) The sulfate ion is reduced

??? success "Answer with Full Explanation"
    **Answer: (B) Aluminum is oxidized and copper is reduced**

    **Detailed Explanation**:

    Step 1: Assign oxidation numbers to key elements
    - Reactants: Al = 0 (free element), Cu in \(CuSO_4\) = +2
    - Products: Al in \(Al_2(SO_4)_3\) = +3, Cu = 0 (free element)

    Step 2: Identify changes
    - Al: 0 → +3 (increase in oxidation number = oxidation, loses 3e-)
    - Cu: +2 → 0 (decrease in oxidation number = reduction, gains 2e-)

    Step 3: Evaluate each choice:
    - (A) WRONG: Al is oxidized (not reduced), Cu is reduced (not oxidized)
    - (B) CORRECT: Al is oxidized and Cu is reduced
    - (C) WRONG: Al is the reducing agent (gets oxidized); Cu²⁺ is the oxidizing agent
    - (D) WRONG: Each Cu²⁺ ion gains 2 electrons, not 3
    - (E) WRONG: Sulfate (SO₄²⁻) is a spectator ion; its oxidation state doesn't change

    **Key Concept**: Species that loses electrons is oxidized; species that gains electrons is reduced.

---

### Problem 2
Given the following standard reduction potentials:
- \(Fe^{3+} + e^- \rightarrow Fe^{2+}\) \(E° = +0.77\) V
- \(Cu^{2+} + 2e^- \rightarrow Cu\) \(E° = +0.34\) V

What is the standard cell potential for the reaction: \(2Fe^{3+} + Cu \rightarrow 2Fe^{2+} + Cu^{2+}\)?

(A) -0.43 V
(B) +0.43 V
(C) +0.68 V
(D) +1.11 V
(E) +1.54 V

??? success "Answer with Full Explanation"
    **Answer: (B) +0.43 V**

    **Detailed Explanation**:

    Step 1: Identify what is being reduced and what is being oxidized
    - From the equation: \(Fe^{3+} \rightarrow Fe^{2+}\) (reduction - Fe gains electrons)
    - From the equation: \(Cu \rightarrow Cu^{2+}\) (oxidation - Cu loses electrons)

    Step 2: Assign cathode and anode
    - Cathode (reduction): \(Fe^{3+} + e^- \rightarrow Fe^{2+}\) with \(E° = +0.77\) V
    - Anode (oxidation): \(Cu \rightarrow Cu^{2+} + 2e^-\) with \(E° = +0.34\) V (use the reduction potential as given)

    Step 3: Apply the formula
    \(E°_{\text{cell}} = E°_{\text{cathode}} - E°_{\text{anode}}\)

    \(E°_{\text{cell}} = (+0.77) - (+0.34)\)

    \(E°_{\text{cell}} = +0.43\) V

    Step 4: Verify
    - Positive cell potential confirms this is a spontaneous reaction
    - The 2:1 stoichiometry does NOT affect the cell potential (intensive property)

    **Key Concept**: Cell potential is ALWAYS calculated as \(E°_{\text{cathode}} - E°_{\text{anode}}\), using reduction potentials for both. Stoichiometric coefficients do NOT affect \(E°\) values.

### Problem 3
In a galvanic cell, which of the following statements is TRUE?

(A) Oxidation occurs at the cathode
(B) Electrons flow from cathode to anode through the external circuit
(C) The anode is the positive electrode
(D) Cations move toward the cathode through the salt bridge
(E) Anions are produced at the anode

??? success "Answer with Full Explanation"
    **Answer: (D) Cations move toward the cathode through the salt bridge**

    **Detailed Explanation**:

    Let's analyze each statement:

    (A) WRONG: Oxidation occurs at the ANODE, not the cathode. Remember AN-OX (Anode-Oxidation).

    (B) WRONG: Electrons flow from ANODE to CATHODE through the external circuit. The anode produces electrons through oxidation.

    (C) WRONG: In a galvanic cell, the anode is NEGATIVE (it releases electrons). The cathode is positive. Note: This is opposite in electrolytic cells!

    (D) CORRECT: Cations (positive ions) in the salt bridge move toward the cathode to balance the excess negative charge that builds up as electrons are consumed there. This maintains electrical neutrality.

    (E) WRONG: The anode undergoes oxidation, which produces CATIONS (positive ions), not anions. For example: \(Zn \rightarrow Zn^{2+} + 2e^-\)

    **Key Concept**: In galvanic cells:
    - Anode: negative, oxidation, produces electrons
    - Cathode: positive, reduction, consumes electrons
    - Salt bridge: allows ion flow to maintain neutrality

### Problem 4
What is the oxidation number of chromium in \(Cr_2O_7^{2-}\)?

(A) +3
(B) +4
(C) +5
(D) +6
(E) +7

??? success "Answer with Full Explanation"
    **Answer: (D) +6**

    **Detailed Explanation**:

    Step 1: Set up the equation
    Let x = oxidation number of Cr

    In \(Cr_2O_7^{2-}\):
    - There are 2 Cr atoms
    - There are 7 O atoms (each with oxidation number -2)
    - The overall charge is 2-

    Step 2: Write the equation
    Sum of oxidation numbers = overall charge

    \(2(x) + 7(-2) = -2\)

    Step 3: Solve for x
    \(2x - 14 = -2\)

    \(2x = -2 + 14\)

    \(2x = 12\)

    \(x = +6\)

    Step 4: Verify
    Check: \(2(+6) + 7(-2) = +12 - 14 = -2\) ✓

    **Key Concept**: For polyatomic ions, the sum of oxidation numbers equals the ion's charge. Oxygen is almost always -2.

### Problem 5
In the electrolysis of molten NaCl, which reaction occurs at the cathode?

(A) \(2Cl^- \rightarrow Cl_2 + 2e^-\)
(B) \(Na^+ + e^- \rightarrow Na\)
(C) \(2Na \rightarrow 2Na^+ + 2e^-\)
(D) \(Cl_2 + 2e^- \rightarrow 2Cl^-\)
(E) \(2H_2O \rightarrow O_2 + 4H^+ + 4e^-\)

??? success "Answer with Full Explanation"
    **Answer: (B) \(Na^+ + e^- \rightarrow Na\)**

    **Detailed Explanation**:

    Step 1: Recall what happens at each electrode
    - Cathode: REDUCTION occurs (gain of electrons)
    - Anode: OXIDATION occurs (loss of electrons)

    Step 2: Analyze each option
    (A) Shows oxidation (electrons produced) - this occurs at ANODE
    (B) Shows reduction (electrons consumed) - this could occur at CATHODE ✓
    (C) Shows oxidation (electrons produced) - this occurs at ANODE
    (D) Shows reduction but this is the wrong reaction for molten NaCl
    (E) Shows oxidation and involves water (we have molten NaCl, not aqueous)

    Step 3: Confirm the chemistry
    In molten NaCl:
    - Cathode: \(Na^+ + e^- \rightarrow Na\) (sodium metal forms)
    - Anode: \(2Cl^- \rightarrow Cl_2 + 2e^-\) (chlorine gas forms)

    **Key Concept**: At the cathode, reduction ALWAYS occurs. In electrolysis of molten salts, cations are reduced to form the metal.

### Problem 6
Which species is the strongest oxidizing agent given the following standard reduction potentials?

- \(F_2 + 2e^- \rightarrow 2F^-\) \(E° = +2.87\) V
- \(Cl_2 + 2e^- \rightarrow 2Cl^-\) \(E° = +1.36\) V
- \(Br_2 + 2e^- \rightarrow 2Br^-\) \(E° = +1.07\) V
- \(I_2 + 2e^- \rightarrow 2I^-\) \(E° = +0.54\) V

(A) F⁻
(B) I₂
(C) F₂
(D) I⁻
(E) All are equally strong oxidizing agents

??? success "Answer with Full Explanation"
    **Answer: (C) F₂**

    **Detailed Explanation**:

    Step 1: Understand what an oxidizing agent does
    - An oxidizing agent CAUSES oxidation in other species
    - It does this by GETTING REDUCED itself (gaining electrons)
    - The stronger the oxidizing agent, the greater its tendency to be reduced

    Step 2: Relate \(E°\) to oxidizing strength
    - A more POSITIVE \(E°\) means greater tendency to be reduced
    - Therefore, more positive \(E°\) = stronger oxidizing agent

    Step 3: Compare the values
    - \(F_2\): \(E° = +2.87\) V (most positive) ← STRONGEST oxidizing agent
    - \(Cl_2\): \(E° = +1.36\) V
    - \(Br_2\): \(E° = +1.07\) V
    - \(I_2\): \(E° = +0.54\) V (least positive)

    Step 4: Evaluate the options
    (A) F⁻ is a reducing agent (product of reduction), not an oxidizing agent
    (B) I₂ has the LOWEST \(E°\), so it's the weakest oxidizing agent
    (C) CORRECT: F₂ has the highest \(E°\) (+2.87 V), making it the strongest oxidizing agent
    (D) I⁻ is a reducing agent, not an oxidizing agent
    (E) WRONG: They have different \(E°\) values, so different strengths

    **Key Concept**: Most positive \(E°\) = strongest oxidizing agent. The species on the LEFT side of the reduction equation is the oxidizing agent.

### Problem 7
Balance the following redox equation in acidic solution:
\(MnO_4^- + Fe^{2+} \rightarrow Mn^{2+} + Fe^{3+}\)

What is the coefficient of \(H^+\) in the balanced equation?

(A) 2
(B) 4
(C) 5
(D) 8
(E) 16

??? success "Answer with Full Explanation"
    **Answer: (D) 8**

    **Detailed Explanation**:

    Step 1: Write the half-reactions

    Oxidation: \(Fe^{2+} \rightarrow Fe^{3+}\)

    Reduction: \(MnO_4^- \rightarrow Mn^{2+}\)

    Step 2: Balance the oxidation half-reaction
    \(Fe^{2+} \rightarrow Fe^{3+} + e^-\)

    (Already balanced)

    Step 3: Balance the reduction half-reaction
    - Mn is already balanced
    - Balance O by adding \(H_2O\): \(MnO_4^- \rightarrow Mn^{2+} + 4H_2O\)
    - Balance H by adding \(H^+\): \(MnO_4^- + 8H^+ \rightarrow Mn^{2+} + 4H_2O\)
    - Balance charge by adding electrons:

    Left side: -1 + 8(+1) = +7

    Right side: +2

    Need 5 electrons on left: \(MnO_4^- + 8H^+ + 5e^- \rightarrow Mn^{2+} + 4H_2O\)

    Step 4: Balance electrons between half-reactions
    - Oxidation produces 1 e⁻ (multiply by 5)
    - Reduction consumes 5 e⁻ (multiply by 1)

    \(5Fe^{2+} \rightarrow 5Fe^{3+} + 5e^-\)

    \(MnO_4^- + 8H^+ + 5e^- \rightarrow Mn^{2+} + 4H_2O\)

    Step 5: Add the half-reactions
    \(MnO_4^- + 8H^+ + 5Fe^{2+} \rightarrow Mn^{2+} + 4H_2O + 5Fe^{3+}\)

    The coefficient of \(H^+\) is **8**.

    **Key Concept**: In acidic solution, balance O with H₂O, then balance H with H⁺, then balance charge with electrons.

### Problem 8
A galvanic cell is constructed with a copper electrode in a \(Cu^{2+}\) solution and a zinc electrode in a \(Zn^{2+}\) solution. As the cell operates, which of the following occurs?

(A) The mass of the copper electrode decreases
(B) The mass of the zinc electrode increases
(C) The concentration of \(Cu^{2+}\) increases
(D) The concentration of \(Zn^{2+}\) increases
(E) Electrons flow from copper to zinc through the wire

??? success "Answer with Full Explanation"
    **Answer: (D) The concentration of \(Zn^{2+}\) increases**

    **Detailed Explanation**:

    Step 1: Determine which metal is oxidized and which is reduced
    - \(Cu^{2+} + 2e^- \rightarrow Cu\) \(E° = +0.34\) V (more positive)
    - \(Zn^{2+} + 2e^- \rightarrow Zn\) \(E° = -0.76\) V (less positive)

    Cu has higher \(E°\), so it's reduced (cathode)
    Zn has lower \(E°\), so it's oxidized (anode)

    Step 2: Write what happens at each electrode
    - Anode (Zn): \(Zn \rightarrow Zn^{2+} + 2e^-\) (zinc metal dissolves)
    - Cathode (Cu): \(Cu^{2+} + 2e^- \rightarrow Cu\) (copper metal deposits)

    Step 3: Analyze each option
    (A) WRONG: Copper electrode INCREASES in mass (Cu metal is deposited)

    (B) WRONG: Zinc electrode DECREASES in mass (Zn metal dissolves)

    (C) WRONG: \(Cu^{2+}\) concentration DECREASES (ions are consumed to form Cu metal)

    (D) CORRECT: \(Zn^{2+}\) concentration INCREASES (produced as Zn metal dissolves)

    (E) WRONG: Electrons flow from zinc (anode) to copper (cathode), not the other way

    **Key Concept**: At the anode, metal dissolves (increases ion concentration). At the cathode, metal deposits (decreases ion concentration).

### Problem 9
Which of the following is NOT a characteristic of a salt bridge in a galvanic cell?

(A) It maintains electrical neutrality in the half-cells
(B) It allows ions to flow between the half-cells
(C) It prevents the mixing of the electrode solutions
(D) It allows electrons to flow between the electrodes
(E) It contains an inert electrolyte

??? success "Answer with Full Explanation"
    **Answer: (D) It allows electrons to flow between the electrodes**

    **Detailed Explanation**:

    Step 1: Understand the function of a salt bridge
    A salt bridge is a U-shaped tube containing an inert electrolyte (like KCl or KNO₃) that connects two half-cells in a galvanic cell.

    Step 2: Evaluate each statement

    (A) TRUE: As electrons leave the anode, positive ions accumulate. As electrons enter the cathode, negative ions accumulate. The salt bridge allows counter-ions to flow, maintaining neutrality.

    (B) TRUE: The salt bridge contains mobile ions that can flow between the half-cells.

    (C) TRUE: The salt bridge is typically filled with a gel or porous plug that prevents the electrode solutions from mixing while allowing ion flow.

    (D) FALSE: Electrons flow through the EXTERNAL WIRE, not through the salt bridge. The salt bridge conducts IONS, not electrons. This is the answer.

    (E) TRUE: The salt bridge contains an inert electrolyte that doesn't react with the half-cell solutions (like KCl, KNO₃, or Na₂SO₄).

    Step 3: Confirm the answer
    The salt bridge is for ION transport. The external wire is for ELECTRON transport. These are separate pathways.

    **Key Concept**: In a galvanic cell, electrons flow through the external circuit (wire), while ions flow through the salt bridge. They serve different purposes and follow different paths.

### Problem 10
Consider the following reaction:
\(3Cu + 8HNO_3 \rightarrow 3Cu(NO_3)_2 + 2NO + 4H_2O\)

How many electrons are transferred when 1 mole of copper reacts?

(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3

(E) 8

??? success "Answer with Full Explanation"
    **Answer: (B) 2**

    **Detailed Explanation**:

    Step 1: Determine the oxidation state change for copper
    - Reactant: Cu (free element) = 0
    - Product: Cu in \(Cu(NO_3)_2\) = +2 (since each \(NO_3^-\) is -1, and we have 2 of them: Cu + 2(-1) = 0, so Cu = +2)

    Oxidation state change: 0 → +2

    Step 2: Determine electrons transferred per copper atom
    Cu loses 2 electrons: \(Cu \rightarrow Cu^{2+} + 2e^-\)

    Step 3: Answer the question
    The question asks for electrons transferred when 1 mole of copper reacts.

    Since each Cu atom loses 2 electrons, 1 mole of Cu loses 2 moles of electrons.

    Answer: **2 electrons per Cu atom**

    Step 4: Verify with nitrogen
    - N in \(HNO_3\): +5
    - N in \(NO\): +2
    - Change: +5 → +2 (gains 3 electrons per N)
    - For 2 moles of NO produced, 2 × 3 = 6 electrons gained

    For 3 moles of Cu oxidized: 3 × 2 = 6 electrons lost ✓

    The electrons balance, confirming our answer.

    **Key Concept**: The number of electrons transferred per atom equals the change in oxidation number. Read the question carefully - it asks per mole of copper, not for the entire equation.

## Answer Key

??? note "Click to reveal answers"
    1. **Oxidation**: Loss of electrons (species becomes more positive). **Reduction**: Gain of electrons (species becomes more negative/less positive).

    2. \(Na\): \(0 \rightarrow +1\) (**oxidized**). \(Cl\): \(0 \rightarrow -1\) (**reduced**).

    3. (a) \(H_2SO_4\): H = +1, S = +6, O = -2. (b) \(NO_3^-\): N = +5, O = -2. (c) \(MnO_4^-\): Mn = +7, O = -2.

    4. **Oxidation**: \(Al \rightarrow Al^{3+} + 3e^-\) (multiply by 2). **Reduction**: \(Cu^{2+} + 2e^- \rightarrow Cu\) (multiply by 3). Balanced: \(2Al \rightarrow 2Al^{3+} + 6e^-\) and \(3Cu^{2+} + 6e^- \rightarrow 3Cu\).

    5. The **anode is negative** (in galvanic cells). **Oxidation occurs at the anode**.

    6. Ag has more positive \(E°\), so it's reduced (cathode). Zn is oxidized (anode). \(E°_{\text{cell}} = (+0.80) - (-0.76) = \mathbf{+1.56 \text{ V}}\).

    7. **Non-spontaneous**. Negative \(E°_{\text{cell}}\) means the reaction requires external energy input.

    8. The salt bridge **maintains electrical neutrality** by allowing ions to flow between half-cells, completing the circuit without allowing solutions to mix.

    9. **Galvanic cell**: Spontaneous redox reaction produces electricity (battery). **Electrolytic cell**: External electricity drives non-spontaneous redox reaction (electrolysis).

    10. **Cathode** produces sodium metal (reduction occurs at cathode). Half-reaction: \(\mathbf{Na^+ + e^- \rightarrow Na}\).
