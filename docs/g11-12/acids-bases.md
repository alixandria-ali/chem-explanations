# Acids and Bases

## Explanation

Acids and bases are fundamental classes of compounds in chemistry. Understanding their properties, strength, and reactions is essential for many applications.

### Key Concepts

**Definitions**:

**Arrhenius Theory**:
- **Acid**: Produces \(H^+\) ions in water (e.g., \(HCl \rightarrow H^+ + Cl^-\))
- **Base**: Produces \(OH^-\) ions in water (e.g., \(NaOH \rightarrow Na^+ + OH^-\))

**Brønsted-Lowry Theory** (broader):
- **Acid**: Proton (\(H^+\)) donor
- **Base**: Proton (\(H^+\)) acceptor
- Example: \(HCl + H_2O \rightarrow H_3O^+ + Cl^-\)
  - \(HCl\) donates \(H^+\) (acid), \(H_2O\) accepts \(H^+\) (base)

**pH Scale**:
- Measures acidity/basicity: \(pH = -\log[H^+]\)
- Scale: 0-14 (at 25°C)
  - \(pH < 7\): acidic
  - \(pH = 7\): neutral
  - \(pH > 7\): basic
- Each pH unit is a factor of 10 in \([H^+]\)
- \(pH + pOH = 14\)
- \(pOH = -\log[OH^-]\)

**Water Ionization**:
- \(H_2O \rightleftharpoons H^+ + OH^-\)
- \(K_w = [H^+][OH^-] = 1.0 \times 10^{-14}\) at 25°C

**Strong vs. Weak Acids**:
- **Strong acids**: Completely ionize in water (e.g., \(HCl\), \(H_2SO_4\), \(HNO_3\))
- **Weak acids**: Partially ionize in water (e.g., \(CH_3COOH\), \(H_2CO_3\))
- Acid strength determined by \(K_a\) (acid dissociation constant)

**Neutralization**:
- Acid + Base → Salt + Water
- Example: \(HCl + NaOH \rightarrow NaCl + H_2O\)
- At equivalence point: moles acid = moles base (for 1:1 reactions)

**Titration**:
- Technique to determine unknown concentration
- Standard solution added to unknown until equivalence point
- Indicator changes color at endpoint

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: Calculating pH from \([H^+]\)

**Problem**: A solution has \([H^+] = 1.0 \times 10^{-3} \text{ M}\). Calculate the pH. Is the solution acidic, basic, or neutral?

**Solution**:
1. Use formula: \(pH = -\log[H^+]\)
2. \(pH = -\log(1.0 \times 10^{-3})\)
3. \(pH = -(-3) = 3\)
4. Since \(pH < 7\), the solution is acidic

**Answer**: pH = 3, acidic

---

### Example 2: Calculating \([OH^-]\) from pH

**Problem**: A solution has pH = 11. Calculate \([H^+]\) and \([OH^-]\).

**Solution**:
1. From pH, find \([H^+]\): \(pH = -\log[H^+]\)
2. \(11 = -\log[H^+]\)
3. \([H^+] = 10^{-11} \text{ M}\)
4. Use \(K_w = [H^+][OH^-] = 1.0 \times 10^{-14}\)
5. \([OH^-] = \frac{K_w}{[H^+]} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.0 \times 10^{-11}} = 1.0 \times 10^{-3} \text{ M}\)

**Answer**: \([H^+] = 1.0 \times 10^{-11} \text{ M}\), \([OH^-] = 1.0 \times 10^{-3} \text{ M}\)

### Example 3: Neutralization Titration Calculation

**Problem**: It takes 25.0 mL of 0.100 M \(NaOH\) to neutralize 50.0 mL of \(HCl\) solution. Calculate the molarity of the \(HCl\) solution.

**Solution**:
1. Equation: \(HCl + NaOH \rightarrow NaCl + H_2O\) (1:1 ratio)
2. At equivalence: moles \(HCl\) = moles \(NaOH\)
3. Moles \(NaOH = M \times V = (0.100 \text{ M})(0.0250 \text{ L}) = 0.00250 \text{ mol}\)
4. Moles \(HCl = 0.00250 \text{ mol}\)
5. Molarity \(HCl = \frac{\text{moles}}{V} = \frac{0.00250 \text{ mol}}{0.0500 \text{ L}} = 0.0500 \text{ M}\)

**Answer**: The \(HCl\) solution is 0.0500 M (or 0.050 M)

## Answer Key

??? note "Click to reveal answers"
    1. (a) **Acid** (produces \(H^+\)), (b) **Base** (produces \(OH^-\)), (c) **Base** (produces \(OH^-\)), (d) **Acid** (produces \(H^+\))

    2. \(pH = -\log(1.0 \times 10^{-8}) = 8\). **Basic** (pH > 7)

    3. \([H^+] = 10^{-5} = \mathbf{1.0 \times 10^{-5} \text{ M}}\). \(pOH = 14 - 5 = \mathbf{9}\)

    4. \([H^+] = \frac{K_w}{[OH^-]} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.0 \times 10^{-4}} = \mathbf{1.0 \times 10^{-10} \text{ M}}\). \(pH = -\log(1.0 \times 10^{-10}) = \mathbf{10}\)

    5. **pH = 2 is more acidic**. \([H^+]\) at pH 2 = \(10^{-2}\); at pH 4 = \(10^{-4}\). Factor: \(\frac{10^{-2}}{10^{-4}} = 10^2 = \mathbf{100 \text{ times more acidic}}\).

    6. **Base**: \(NH_3\) (accepts \(H^+\) from water to form \(NH_4^+\)). **Acid**: \(H_2O\) (donates \(H^+\)).

    7. \(\mathbf{H_2SO_4 + 2KOH \rightarrow K_2SO_4 + 2H_2O}\) (Note: \(H_2SO_4\) is diprotic, so 2:1 ratio)

    8. Moles \(HNO_3 = (0.200)(0.0300) = 0.00600\) mol. Moles \(NaOH\) needed = 0.00600 mol (1:1 ratio). Volume \(= \frac{0.00600}{0.150} = \mathbf{0.0400 \text{ L} = 40.0 \text{ mL}}\)

    9. \(pH = 14 - 9 = \mathbf{5}\). **Acidic** (pH < 7)

    10. \(HCl\) **completely ionizes** in water (\(HCl \rightarrow H^+ + Cl^-\), 100% dissociation), making it a strong acid. \(CH_3COOH\) **partially ionizes** (\(CH_3COOH \rightleftharpoons H^+ + CH_3COO^-\), <5% dissociation), making it a weak acid.
