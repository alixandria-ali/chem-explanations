# Chemical Equilibrium

## Explanation

Chemical equilibrium occurs in reversible reactions when the forward and reverse reaction rates are equal. Understanding equilibrium is crucial for predicting reaction behavior and optimizing conditions.

### Key Concepts

**Reversible Reactions**:
- Can proceed in both forward and reverse directions
- Indicated by double arrow: $A + B \rightleftharpoons C + D$
- At equilibrium: rate forward = rate reverse
- Concentrations remain constant (but reactions continue)

**Equilibrium Constant ($K_c$)**:
- For $aA + bB \rightleftharpoons cC + dD$:
$$K_c = \frac{[C]^c[D]^d}{[A]^a[B]^b}$$
- $[~]$ indicates concentration in mol/L (M)
- Pure solids and liquids are omitted from expression
- $K_c > 1$: products favored at equilibrium
- $K_c < 1$: reactants favored at equilibrium
- $K_c$ depends only on temperature

**Reaction Quotient ($Q$)**:
- Same form as $K_c$, but uses current concentrations (not equilibrium)
- Compare $Q$ to $K_c$ to predict direction:
  - $Q < K_c$: reaction shifts right (toward products)
  - $Q > K_c$: reaction shifts left (toward reactants)
  - $Q = K_c$: system is at equilibrium

**Le Chatelier's Principle**:
When a stress is applied to a system at equilibrium, the system shifts to relieve the stress.

- **Concentration change**: Adding reactant/product shifts to consume it
- **Pressure change** (gases): Increasing pressure shifts toward fewer moles of gas
- **Temperature change**:
  - Exothermic reaction ($\Delta H < 0$): Increasing T shifts toward reactants
  - Endothermic reaction ($\Delta H > 0$): Increasing T shifts toward products
- **Catalyst**: Speeds up both forward and reverse rates equally; no shift in position

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: Writing Equilibrium Expressions

**Problem**: Write the equilibrium constant expression ($K_c$) for:
$$2NO_{2(g)} \rightleftharpoons N_2O_{4(g)}$$

**Solution**:
1. General form: $K_c = \frac{\text{[products]}}{\text{[reactants]}}$ with stoichiometric coefficients as exponents
2. Products: $[N_2O_4]^1$
3. Reactants: $[NO_2]^2$
4. $K_c = \frac{[N_2O_4]}{[NO_2]^2}$

**Answer**: $K_c = \frac{[N_2O_4]}{[NO_2]^2}$

### Example 2: Calculating Equilibrium Constant

**Problem**: At equilibrium, $[H_2] = 0.20 \text{ M}$, $[I_2] = 0.20 \text{ M}$, and $[HI] = 1.2 \text{ M}$ for the reaction:
$$H_{2(g)} + I_{2(g)} \rightleftharpoons 2HI_{(g)}$$

Calculate $K_c$.

**Solution**:
1. Write $K_c$ expression: $K_c = \frac{[HI]^2}{[H_2][I_2]}$
2. Substitute equilibrium concentrations:
3. $K_c = \frac{(1.2)^2}{(0.20)(0.20)} = \frac{1.44}{0.040} = 36$

**Answer**: $K_c = 36$

### Example 3: Applying Le Chatelier's Principle

**Problem**: For the exothermic reaction:
$$N_{2(g)} + 3H_{2(g)} \rightleftharpoons 2NH_{3(g)} \quad \Delta H = -92 \text{ kJ}$$

Predict the effect on equilibrium of:
(a) Adding more $N_2$
(b) Removing $NH_3$
(c) Increasing temperature
(d) Increasing pressure

**Solution**:
1. (a) Adding $N_2$ (reactant): System shifts **right** to consume added $N_2$, producing more $NH_3$
2. (b) Removing $NH_3$ (product): System shifts **right** to replace removed $NH_3$, consuming reactants
3. (c) Increasing temperature: For exothermic reaction, heat is a product. Adding heat (increasing T) shifts **left** toward reactants
4. (d) Increasing pressure: Left side has 4 moles gas ($1 + 3$), right side has 2 moles. System shifts **right** toward fewer moles to reduce pressure

**Answer**: (a) shifts right; (b) shifts right; (c) shifts left; (d) shifts right

## Practice Problems

1. What does it mean when a reaction is at equilibrium? Are the concentrations equal?

2. Write the $K_c$ expression for: $2SO_{2(g)} + O_{2(g)} \rightleftharpoons 2SO_{3(g)}$

3. For the reaction $A + B \rightleftharpoons C$, if $K_c = 100$, are products or reactants favored?

4. Given: $PCl_{5(g)} \rightleftharpoons PCl_{3(g)} + Cl_{2(g)}$ with $K_c = 0.050$. At equilibrium, $[PCl_5] = 0.10 \text{ M}$ and $[Cl_2] = 0.15 \text{ M}$. Calculate $[PCl_3]$.

5. For $N_2O_{4(g)} \rightleftharpoons 2NO_{2(g)}$, current concentrations are $[N_2O_4] = 0.50 \text{ M}$ and $[NO_2] = 0.20 \text{ M}$. If $K_c = 0.10$, calculate $Q$ and predict the direction of shift.

6. For the endothermic reaction $CaCO_{3(s)} \rightleftharpoons CaO_{(s)} + CO_{2(g)}$, what happens to equilibrium if:
   (a) Temperature increases?
   (b) $CO_2$ is removed?

7. For $H_{2(g)} + I_{2(g)} \rightleftharpoons 2HI_{(g)}$, a catalyst is added. How does this affect the equilibrium position?

8. For $2NO_{2(g)} \rightleftharpoons N_2O_{4(g)}$ (exothermic), the mixture is brown due to $NO_2$. If cooled, will the color darken or lighten? Explain.

9. If $K_c = 4.0 \times 10^{-3}$ for a reaction at 500 K, are products or reactants favored? If temperature increases and $K_c$ increases, is the reaction endothermic or exothermic?

10. For $A_{(g)} + B_{(g)} \rightleftharpoons 2C_{(g)}$, how does increasing pressure affect equilibrium?

## Answer Key

??? note "Click to reveal answers"
    1. At equilibrium, the **forward and reverse reaction rates are equal**, so concentrations remain constant. Concentrations are **not necessarily equal** to each other, just constant.

    2. $K_c = \frac{[SO_3]^2}{[SO_2]^2[O_2]}$

    3. **Products favored**. $K_c > 1$ means the numerator (products) is larger than denominator (reactants).

    4. $K_c = \frac{[PCl_3][Cl_2]}{[PCl_5]}$. Rearrange: $[PCl_3] = \frac{K_c \cdot [PCl_5]}{[Cl_2]} = \frac{(0.050)(0.10)}{0.15} = \frac{0.005}{0.15} = \mathbf{0.033 \text{ M}}$

    5. $Q = \frac{[NO_2]^2}{[N_2O_4]} = \frac{(0.20)^2}{0.50} = \frac{0.04}{0.50} = 0.08$. Since $Q (0.08) < K_c (0.10)$, the reaction **shifts right** toward products.

    6. (a) Endothermic means heat is a reactant. Increasing T shifts **right**, favoring products. (b) Removing $CO_2$ (product) shifts **right** to replace it.

    7. **No effect** on equilibrium position. A catalyst speeds up both forward and reverse reactions equally, so equilibrium is reached faster but the position doesn't change.

    8. Color will **lighten**. Cooling an exothermic reaction shifts right toward $N_2O_4$ (colorless), consuming brown $NO_2$.

    9. **Reactants favored** ($K_c < 1$). If $K_c$ increases with temperature, the reaction **shifts right** when heated, meaning it's **endothermic** (heat favors products).

    10. **No effect**. Both sides have equal moles of gas (1 + 1 = 2 on left, 2 on right), so pressure changes don't shift equilibrium.
